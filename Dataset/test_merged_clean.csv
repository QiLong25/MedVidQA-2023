Its about a quarter inch wide.and maybe an inch long.and Im doing this so you can see it.Actually she used scotch tape. Bob Did she really  Yeah Ive done that too.I mean Ive done this too cause Im guilty of snoring. You may wanna get some tape.thats for the you know for the skin.that is hypersensitive you know.Cause you could start to break the skin down. Right see.Cause I could talk with this.and I can breathe through here.So it doesnt choke you and theres a skinny little tape.because if something happens where you wanna open it.you know  It breaks right open. It breaks up very easily," Bob and Brad   The two most famous   Physical therapists on the internet  All right.(clapping loudly).Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, Physical Therapist.Brad Heineck Physical Therapist.Together we are the most famous.physical therapists on the internet.In our opinion of course Bob.Turn my mic on now so you can hear me.Today, we're gonna talk about.how to sleep all night without being awakened.from snoring or dry mouth.Those are two different issues.We're gonna go over them separately.We're also gonna talk about some home remedies.Right, absolutely Bob.If one of you or your family members.or someone in the house.has got problems with snoring or dry mouth,.and both my wife and I have dealt with this.I don't know if it's the aging process or what,.but it's an issue in our house and we've came up,.you know, I wanna share what we've learned,.but I know we're not the only ones.Well this is where our audience.is gonna start to benefit from us getting older.'Cause as we get things,.we're gonna do videos on 'em or as our family members.So, we're gonna be doin' lots of things on as we age.And it's because we care Bob.Yeah, we care.So by the way, if you're new to our channel,.please take a second to subscribe to us.We provide videos, how to stay healthy,.live pain free for you.We upload every day.Also go to bobandbradcom and go to the giveaway section,.'cause we're always giving something away,.every week we're having a contest.What, what're we doin'?.This week we're giving away the wall anchor.So this is a anchor you attach to your wall.and you can easily attach resistance bands to 'em-.You have to stretch it- You can workout with them.You don't have to anchor on a bolt?.No, not anchor on a bolt or an anchor around your neck.So, you can go to Facebook, the contest.Also, we pinned it to the top of the page,.our Facebook page.Go to Twitter or Instagram or TikTok.if you want a 60 second version of our program.All right Brad.Well, first of all, I think what we wanna do,.or what I decided to do is,.'cause it's our show and it's my choice on this one.I tackle snoring.Snoring first.Right, I mean-.Big problem for a lot of people.Exactly right, if you don't snore someone in your house,.and either way, it can affect the whole household.Right, right.Like I was telling you earlier,.my you know, when my daughter was,.you know, before she left the house,.actually, you know, she didn't just leave,.anyways- She went to the college.We kept her awake many nights from our snoring,.not just me, but my wife as well.And so that's a problem.So, why do you snore?.It happens because when you fall asleep.the muscles in your throat, they relax.and with open mouth breathing.it starts to get these vibrations.And you know, it can be like my dad,.we always joked it's a chainsaw, you know?.Right.How many cords of wood did you cut last night Dad?.Yeah, I had a friend that stayed at our cabin,.it was unreal, it was a phenomenon, I mean.Did you hand out earplugs?.Oh, I mean I had doors shut.and you could hear him, I mean.(giggling).I mean, I think the town was complaining.Yeah, we don't wanna talk about it.that'll make the news.What seriously, you can get this looked at by a doctor.I think you should.You can talk to them.One thing they might do,.this is we're not doin' this video.to promote this necessarily,.'cause you probably don't need it,.but sometimes a sleep study.You'll go in and yes you sleep.and they hook you up and look at your heart rate.and monitor you as you sleep.Well, I wanted to say this Brad,.it often is a sign of sleep apnea.and sleep apnea is not to be taken lightly.I mean, it could lead to a lot of medical issues.Right, I've heard people say,.I'm not willing to accept this personally yet,.but you know, if I ever need one,.because I don't wanna be hooked up to a thing,.but I know many people say,.once they got a C-PAP they realized-.How much sleep they were missing out on.Well, they wake up in the morning.with so much more energy,.'cause they weren't oxygen deprived.that slight amount for eight hours.So, that's one possible thing.Oral devices, they make custom ones.that you can put in your mouth that help.Appliances that are custom made for your mouth right?.Exactly.Or you know, worst case scenario, surgery.But we're lookin' at you feel pretty confident.You're a healthy person, but you got this snoring thing.You know, maybe you could just try something simple.that the worst it's gonna do is not help.Help the snoring.You know, one of the harder things,.you know, if you happened to be a heavier person,.if you lose some weight that can reduce.some of the soft tissue.Yeah, we're talkin' about the ones.that are gonna be very difficult to do.Yeah, that ones not a-.We know everybody wants to lose weight-.Right, stop smoking!.That's a tough one.Another tough one.Y'all know it.And but a lot of you aren't able to do it.It's like a monkey on your back quite often.Don't worry, we're saving the easy one for last.So just hang in there folks.Allergies, if you're dealing with allergies,.if you can get a medication that eliminates that.That's an easier one.Yeah, that is, but this is the one,.because my wife and I decided to go all the way.to the very easiest one.A good friend of mine was having problems with this.while he was goin' through a cancer treatment.and his dry mouth was-.Well, we're talkin' about snoring first.Snoring, I'm getting to that, yeah.But, tape your mouth and you know where he learned it from?.And I found out, this is where you're gonna find.a lot of these tricks is not from a medical doctor,.but from a dentist.'Cause the dentist, this is his area of study.Actually, the oral cavity in the world.Hey, that's all they do.So, you didn't mention.sleeping on your side though Brad.Oh, thank you for reminding me Bob.You can try sleeping on your side.They also have those nasal strips.You said your wife tried those?.Exactly, she put those little things,.that they're kind of spring loaded,.you tape 'em down and they're not that expensive.And then they change and we don't know.for sure- That it helped?.Well, what happened was she put those on.as well as taping her mouth.Could she breathe?.Yes, yes, I'm gonna show you in just a little bit here,.but yeah, I slept like a baby,.she was quiet all night long.I had to wake up a couple of times.to make sure she was alive.Well, you'd wonder.You taped her nose shut and you taped her mouth shut,.yeah, I would wonder if she's alive too.Seriously for the tape,.you can just use a little baby.one of those little skinny band-aids.For you on the podcast,.all he has just a little thin piece of tape.It's about a quarter inch wide.and maybe an inch long.and I'm doing this so you can see it.Actually, she used scotch tape.[Bob] Did she really Yeah, I've done that too.I mean, I've done this too 'cause I'm guilty of snoring.You may wanna get some tape.that's for the, you know, for the skin.that is hypersensitive, you know?.'Cause you could start to break the skin down-.Right, see.'Cause I could talk with this.and I can breathe through here.So, it doesn't choke you and there's a skinny little tape,.because if something happens where you wanna open it,.you know- It breaks right open.It breaks up very easily.So, ouch!.(laughing).That point when we woke up,.we didn't know where my wife's tape was,.""did you swallow it?"".Ah, Geez.It was okay, we found it.So, anyways, yeah, there you go.Give it a try.Now, do you sleep on your side.or do you sleep on your back a lot?.A little bit of both.You know, I can't sleep on my side very long.because my back starts to be uncomfortable.Then I go back to my back.But yeah, I'm definitely snoring,.but I have a dry mouth issue.Sure, that's the second part,.part two of this video and podcast-.Of the saga that's goin' on at our house.as well as other houses-.Brad's world.Yeah, so the thing about dry mouth.is the medical term is xerostomia.Xerostomia, I know stomia means opening.Yeah, and I didn't look up Xero.it's probably a Latin word.And it's one of those words that's tricky,.because it starts with a X, but it sounds like a Z.That kind of thing bothers me.So, if your a English major out there.and you know why they do that,.I want a comment or two explaining that.So, xerostomia, dry mouth that causes of it.Now this is different than snoring.This is something I really think.you should talk to your doctor about.to clarify any problems.If you're a diabetic,.it may be a problem associated with it.If you had a stroke,.which you would probably know, that could be it.Or medication- Yeah, we see that a lot.I mean- Your medications.can cause dry mouth.Sometimes we have a saliva gland that has a problem.You want to get that checked out.So and again, dentist is probably the better source.than a medical doctor.Unless you got the medications from the medical doctor.Right, it's a good one to bring up with the doctor,.either one and see what they think.Right, if you're a healthy person you're not taking meds,.in my case, you know, that's the way I feel.As far as I know, I'm healthy and I keep track of myself,.I sleep with my mouth open and that's why I snore.But then it's dry in the house,.we don't have a dehumidifier going right now.Actually we have a-.You want humidifier?.Humidifier, right.So, I've got this dry air goin' in and out of my mouth.and you ever wake up and my mouth feels like sandpaper.Everything in there.It's like, the first time it happened,.I felt like, I was afraid, I thought,.I had to learn to talk again.So we went to the you know-.What a tragedy that would be.(giggling).Well, I went and I got some water.and it started to saturate like a sponge.It went back like normal, I felt pretty good.But anyways, it is a little scary.if you've never had it happen,.it's just dry as can be.Interesting Yeah.So anyways, put water by your bed,.the first little home remedy.So, you just wake up, drink some water and go back to bed.A humidifier in your bedroom.can be a nice way to help so it doesn't dry up.like the Sahara desert.And then of course no alcohol or caffeine.within a few hours before you go to bed.Right and we also forgot to mention.that's actually for snoring too.Alcohol can all enhance that.So we had to move our happy hour,.you know, from six o'clock until three o'clock.to eliminate that that possibility.(giggling).It's five o'clock somewhere.And then again, the same thing and this actually.He tried to tape this too.I gotta admit that I think it works better for snoring,.'cause you still, I'll have problems.when breathing in this way.So I get it, not near as bad,.but there's still a little dry mouth issues with this,.but you know, again, it's worth a try.It may do very well for a lot of people-.So the obvious joke is Brad, your wife requested.that you wear the tape all day long.and maybe a bigger piece.I mean, I'm sure that's come across her mind.That's pretty funny, yeah, you go to bed, get the tape.Yeah, get the tape.(giggling).It's time to get the tape in place.Yeah, it makes life in the bedroom amazing, so anyways.Stuff that you have to do when you get older,.I'll tell ya-.Sleep well, quietly and enjoy a nice-.And remember Brad and I can fix just about anything-.Oh yeah, except for-.We fixed snoring and everything else,.but we can't fix a broken heart.There you go, good luck with this.We made a little humor out of it, but that's life","{'(0.36, 2.216)': ' Bob and Brad  , '(2.216, 4.338)': ' The two

PdMJAhD7NEw,How to fix chronic neck tension while lying down on the ground?,"(113, 277)",exercises to actually permanently fix.this problem okay so as I said at the.outset you can do these exercises at.home or in the gym you dont even need.any equipment Im going to lie down on.my tummy to show you your position to.start working those middle.and lower traps now these are really.basic beginners exercises to getting.these muscles started lying down on your.tummy and Im going to use the pillow.underneath my pelvis you might like to.do that at home or in the gym as well or.something to lift your pelvis.particularly if your back curve curves.in a long way so it actually stops that.large inward curve in your lower back so.lying down in this position coming down.now your forehead needs to be in contact.with the ground your arms are down and.your palms are facing downwards so Im.in that position now your head stays in.contact with the ground during the whole.exercise the first exercise is to pull.the shoulders away from the ears now can.you try that at home or wherever you are.head down pull the shoulders away from.your ears and then actually starts to.activate those lower trapezius muscles I.was showing you on the diagram for.earlier now second step is pull your.shoulders away from your ears squeeze.your shoulder together and lift your.hands just off the ground and now lower.them down slowly and relax now youll.rarely know if youre doing this.incorrectly if you tend to be tight.through your upper traps this is what.youll do youll lift and youll pull up.that way and thats those muscles at the.top theyre working against the lower.one so we want to pull the shoulders.away from the ears just a little bit so.youre lengthening youre lifting and.youre squeezing and coming down slowly.and relaxing so thats the first thing.you can do now if youd like to start.progressing that exercise a little bit.you can use a couple of weights or if.youre at home you can use maybe a.couple of tin cans out of the cupboard.so Ive got what have I got here one.kilo you could use arms start with half.a pound one pound coming down but you.start with lightweights when youre.first starting out with you dont start.with heavy weights again head is down.alright so Im going to pull my.shoulders away from my ears and just.lifting up squeezing my shoulder blades.together so Im working my middle and.lower traps and Im coming down slowly.and Im releasing okay one more time.squeezing shoulder blades together.pulling away from the ears and lifting.up not very high is it just a little bit.off the ground coming back down slowly.and releasing and coming back up so you.can see thats starting to strengthen.through the middle of the back now I do,[Music].hi I'm Michele today we're going to talk.about how to release tight neck and.shoulder muscles for good now have you.had the problem where you repeatedly.need to get treatment for getting tight.neck and shoulders you get your.treatment you have to go back it feels.great.you have to go back then a couple of.days later to get treated again and the.neck gets tight again today I'm going to.show you a couple of simple exercises to.get some permanent relief and to.overcome this typical problem of being.tight through this area of your neck and.shoulders all the time so I'm going to.talk about a couple of exercises and.they're really simple exercises you can.start doing at home or in the gym for.these muscles that we need to look at.let's get started okay so before we.start I just need you to bear with me.for a moment so I can show you which.muscles you're working and why so this.is a poster of this superficial or.outer back muscles and you can see in.the purple clear these muscles these are.called your trapezius muscles now.there's three parts to these muscles and.you need to know about all of them to.properly address this problem it's the.upper trapezius and these muscles go.from at the back of the shoulder blade.and they attach up here into the back of.the neck these upper traps here lift.your shoulders and roll them forward so.they really good at creating neck pain.the middle traps actually squeeze the.shoulder blades together and the lower.traps here actually pull the shoulders.back and down.so these top muscles the upper traps.work against the lower traps so you can.see the solution or the permanent.solution to this problem is to.strengthen the middle and lower traps so.that they can oppose these upper traps.so we're going to be working at these.muscles here working down and back and.counteracting these muscles pulling out.to typing so let me show you the.exercises to actually permanently fix.this problem okay so as I said at the.outset you can do these exercises at.home or in the gym you don't even need.any equipment I'm going to lie down on.my tummy to show you your position to.start working those middle.and lower traps now these are really.basic beginners exercises to

6kQEDRQdJZ8,How to identify if you may have a pinched nerve?,"(28, 171)", Sure. So first lets talk about the symptoms.What are the things youre gonna feel when.you have a pinched nerve.One thing you might have quite often is pain.cause youre getting compression.on a nerve is what is is happening.And the nerves are coming out.from your spinal cord and going.from the spinal cord into your arms.and into your legs. And in this area they wrap around the trunk. Sure They wrap around the trunk.so you can get actually pain.or a compression of a nerve anywhere.in the body in essence. Right. So lets start talking.about some of the common symptoms youre gonna feel.First off you can have pain.you can have radiating pain pain.thats going down. Right. The extremity you can have. Numbness burning tingling.A lot of times people in the clinic.I know that when they got it in their low back.and its going down their leg I just.had a woman yesterday.It feels real tight a pulling sensation. Right. Its hard to describe a nerve pain compared.to like a pain where youre you know.if you break your arm.or a mechanical pain is very clear.where nerve pain is also. It can be ever changing too. Yep exactly weird. Quite often when people start getting.and thats a good way to put it.A lot of times when people come in.theyre having really strange symptoms.I often go you know what.That sounds like nerve pain cause nerve pain.It just gives you really weird things.You can get like hot and cold sensations. Sure Yeah exactly. Pins and needles.If you start getting weakness in the arm.thats often quite often can be. Thats getting more serious. Thats getting more serious spasms.that can be from from nerve compression too. And and one thing I wanna point out.as a therapist or a physician.or a chiropractor we pay attention.to where that you feel the pain you know.is it on the front of your arm.or the back of the arm inside of the leg.outside of the leg because that tells us possibly.which nerve is actually being pinched.We know its all mapped out where L three.the nerve coming out of L three and your Lumbar spine.where that goes down in your leg you know what.L five goes down the top of your foot.if you feel symptoms there. Right.So where youre having the pain.it could be where youre having the pinch nerve.but quite often it isnt. Right. And its a real its a real treasure hunt here.Kind of trying to figure out investigative job.trying to figure out where.the problem is coming from,"Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck physical therapist.And together we are the most famous physical.therapists on the internet.In our opinion of course.Think fast Today we're gonna talk.about what is a pinch nerve.A lot of people get a pinch nerve.or they get a pain.And they say they've been diagnosed.and they say, well somewhere you.have a pinch nerve.We're gonna kind of go talk.about where you can pinch a nerve.and what it is and, and what,.what symptoms it gives you.Sure.So first let's talk about the symptoms.What are the things you're gonna feel when.you have a pinched nerve?.One thing you might have quite often is pain.'cause you're getting compression.on a nerve is what is is happening.And the nerves are coming out.from your spinal cord and going.from the spinal cord into your arms.and into your legs.And in this area, they wrap around the trunk.Sure They wrap around the trunk.so you can get actually pain.or a compression of a nerve anywhere.in the body in essence.Right.So let's start talking.about some of the common symptoms you're gonna feel.First off, you can have pain.you can have radiating pain, pain,.that's going down.Right?.The extremity, you can have-.Numbness, burning, tingling.A lot of times, people in the clinic.I know that when they got it in their low back.and it's going down their leg, I just.had a woman yesterday.It feels real tight, a pulling sensation.Right.It's hard to describe a nerve pain compared.to like a pain where you're, you know,.if you break your arm.or a mechanical pain is very clear.where nerve pain is also.It can be ever changing too.Yep, exactly weird.Quite often when people start getting.and that's a good way to put it.A lot of times when people come in.they're having really strange symptoms.I often go, you know what?.That sounds like nerve pain, 'cause nerve pain.It just gives you really weird things.You can get like hot and cold sensations.Sure Yeah, exactly.Pins and needles.If you start getting weakness in the arm,.that's often quite often can be-.That's getting more serious.That's getting more serious spasms.that can be from from nerve compression too.And, and one thing I wanna point out.as a therapist or a physician.or a chiropractor, we pay attention.to where that you feel the pain, you know,.is it on the front of your arm.or the back of the arm, inside of the leg.outside of the leg, because that tells us possibly.which nerve is actually being pinched.We know it's all mapped out where L three.the nerve coming out of L three and your Lumbar spine.where that goes down in your leg, you know what?.L five goes down the top of your foot.if you feel symptoms there.Right.So where you're having the pain.it could be where you're having the pinch nerve.but quite often it isn't.Right.And it's a real, it's a real treasure hunt here.Kind of trying to figure out investigative job.trying to figure out where.the problem is coming from.So let's talk about a couple, some.of the common areas where you might.have a pinch nerve.Nancy, could we have the spine right away?.Who's catching.There ya go.Okay We got our spine here.Spine.This is really where a partial head here.These are the bones that stack.up to make your back, you know,.within the bones itself there's a canal.and that's your spinal cord.And coming off the spinal cord are these nerves.All right these are the nerves.that can get compressed or pinched.Right.All right One of the common areas.that can get pinched is right.when it's coming outta these holes here,.the right right in that spot here,.as you get older you want to zoom in.and Brad, can you kind of point out?.Sure Yep.Okay So now the nerves remember.are not a half inch long like I'm here.They, they actually, the nerves.are go down into your arm the nerves.and this area will wrap around your chest.and the ones out here go down to your legs.But here's that whole valve talking.about where the nerve exits.from the spinal cord directly connected.to the spinal cord.As you get older there,.your neck will become arthritic.Sure.I can tell you from age 20 on it's deteriorating.these holes start to get smaller just.from arthritic changes.Right.And so there's less room.for the nerve to get out.If let's say the nerve gets a little bit.swollen suddenly there's, there's no room.for it to come out and it's getting pinched right.Where as it comes out.Sure.Less common in the lumbar area.cause these holes are quite bigger.but what can happen in the lumbar area?.Brad, bigger, the holes there are larger,.Larger.Okay The holes there are larger.Okay.And so there's a lot more room.for the nerves to come out.So it's unlikely that you're gonna get pinching.from the hole itself in the lumbar area.but you can get a disc problem.And here's a nice model.You talk about a slip disc.That's really not correct is a herniated disc.and a herniated disc, you can see here.Can you zoom in on this pretty good?.The bald dried here?.Why don't you show a healthy disc first, Brad.This is a healthy disc.Sure That's a good idea.A healthy disc is kept in here.Usually a little thicker in the front.a little narrower in the back and.It's all contained it.Exactly.Boy We know we've got another video.on some details on the disc without getting into.that the disc will actually bulge out.Put Pressure.Yeah.Put pressure on the, on a specific nerve.And that nerve will send symptoms wherever.that nerve tracks.And here they go down into the leg.And that the.the pain that you get often.from nerve pain is off quite often.Some of the worst pain you'll have.Yeah It is.Nerve pain is not fun.Exactly.I know when you can tell.when someone's drilling into a nerve.that, you know that's the way they'll.make you talk, If they wanna torture you.So the other thing that could be causing pressure.on a nerve is even scar tissue.Sure.If you a nerve, the nerve.can actually get scarred down.and when you move it,.it actually puts pressure on it.Cause increased pain.We've had sometimes I've had people that have.had scar tissue on a nerve in their back.And we actually had to stretch that nerve.Right.To break up that scar tissue.After a surgery sometimes you.can have scarred filled up or an injury.So the other thing is, as the nerves come out.anywhere along this path,.they can get pinched somewhere.Sure.And the common one that many of you probably.know about is carpal tunnel syndrome.and there's a band or ligament.that goes across here and the.the nerve crosses underneath that ligament.And especially if you do a lot.of repetitive activities like typing.or where you're bending your wrist this way.or this way or.Factory type work.Or factory type work that ligament.can thicken up and there's less room.for the nerve to go under.And that's where you can get pinched nerve also.So the job of the physician or doctor.or physical therapist is to figure out.where along this path for your arms,.are you getting a pinch nerve or where along.you know your legs, where from the back to the legs.are you getting a pinched nerve.Right.And which we usually call sciatica.Sure.The other thing we thought.we talked about a couple fun ones, right?.Brad, there's some names out there for.for nerves that get pinched.And these are the ones that are generally more.of a temporary pinch.but one is called Saturday night palsy.And this is apparently what happens.if you fall asleep like.on a bar or over the, over a chair like that.you get pressure on the back of your nerve, your.your arm there, that's a radial nerve palsy.and you wake up and you're so drunk.that you, you don't wake up at all.You wake up in your arms,.you can't move your arms.They're they're they're yeah.They, they, they cut off so much that the.the nerves cannot fire the muscles.It's I've never experienced that.You don't even know what that would be.But another one would be.honeymoon Phoneymoon palsy.You fall asleep and your honey's.on your arm like this.Yeah This looks like your honey.Yeah This is my honey.And all night long, you're afraid.to get away from her.And there's a joke too, about nodding off.That also causes a palsy in your arm.Another one is, could be related.as a handcuff neuropathy.I wouldn't about that either.That are too tight.they can actually put pressure on the nerves.And the last one we're gonna mention is,.is a crutch palsy.I wish we had some crutches here but.that's why when we, when you use crutches we try.to teach you that you're really not trying to.to hang on them or, or lean on to them onto them.It should not put pressure to your armpit,.Right.It should be going through your arm.You got a big plexus of nerves coming.through your armpit here and into the arm.And if you lean on those crutches.they're actually going to cause.the crutch pad is not made for padding.to put up-.The pressure should be on your.your palms.Right.And squeezing the, the crutches in.So that they're-.I got another one though Bob.I can show you this one,.Another palsy?.Yeah I don't know what you call it,.but she can't see me.Oh.If I go to sleep on my stomach.which I don't much anymore.Cause I bother with my back.But if I sleep like this.I've waken up and hours are completely.sleep completely I can't do anything.I've already done this.And I bit my hand, ah, like you.can't feel those thing.It's pretty fun.Oh, I actually, I woke up one time.and the alarm's going off in both arms like that.Yeah And I'm going like this, turn, the knock.turn the alarm off.That's kinda fun.The other one that is a common one that is.you're driving along.This is why you shouldn't wear your wallet.and your back pocket.Yeah.You're gonna -you're gonna actually.pressure on your CIC nerve.And I had it one time where my foot fell asleep.and I was hitting the brake.and I couldn't feel it.And I'm coming to a stop light and I.I can't stop the car because I'm pushing as well.All my might.So I stopped wearing my wallet in the back.Yeah.Back pocket there.That's that big thick wallet.Well, I just got papers in it.There there's nothing else in it.Believe me.All right","{'(10.607, 11.885)':  'All right', '(155.634, 156.46699999999998)':  'Right', '(240.2, 241.79)':  'Exactly', '(5.1, 6.279999999999999)':

The other thing we thought.we talked about a couple fun ones right.Brad theres some names out there for.for nerves that get pinched.And these are the ones that are generally more.of a temporary pinch.but one is called Saturday night palsy.And this is apparently what happens.if you fall asleep like.on a bar or over the over a chair like that.you get pressure on the back of your nerve your.your arm there thats a radial nerve palsy.and you wake up and youre so drunk.that you you dont wake up at all.You wake up in your arms.you cant move your arms.Theyre theyre theyre yeah. They they they cut off so much that the.the nerves cannot fire the muscles.Its Ive never experienced that. You dont even know what that would be,"Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck physical therapist.And together we are the most famous physical.therapists on the internet.In our opinion of course.Think fast Today we're gonna talk.about what is a pinch nerve.A lot of people get a pinch nerve.or they get a pain.And they say they've been diagnosed.and they say, well somewhere you.have a pinch nerve.We're gonna kind of go talk.about where you can pinch a nerve.and what it is and, and what,.what symptoms it gives you.Sure.So first let's talk about the symptoms.What are the things you're gonna feel when.you have a pinched nerve?.One thing you might have quite often is pain.'cause you're getting compression.on a nerve is what is is happening.And the nerves are coming out.from your spinal cord and going.from the spinal cord into your arms.and into your legs.And in this area, they wrap around the trunk.Sure They wrap around the trunk.so you can get actually pain.or a compression of a nerve anywhere.in the body in essence.Right.So let's start talking.about some of the common symptoms you're gonna feel.First off, you can have pain.you can have radiating pain, pain,.that's going down.Right?.The extremity, you can have-.Numbness, burning, tingling.A lot of times, people in the clinic.I know that when they got it in their low back.and it's going down their leg, I just.had a woman yesterday.It feels real tight, a pulling sensation.Right.It's hard to describe a nerve pain compared.to like a pain where you're, you know,.if you break your arm.or a mechanical pain is very clear.where nerve pain is also.It can be ever changing too.Yep, exactly weird.Quite often when people start getting.and that's a good way to put it.A lot of times when people come in.they're having really strange symptoms.I often go, you know what?.That sounds like nerve pain, 'cause nerve pain.It just gives you really weird things.You can get like hot and cold sensations.Sure Yeah, exactly.Pins and needles.If you start getting weakness in the arm,.that's often quite often can be-.That's getting more serious.That's getting more serious spasms.that can be from from nerve compression too.And, and one thing I wanna point out.as a therapist or a physician.or a chiropractor, we pay attention.to where that you feel the pain, you know,.is it on the front of your arm.or the back of the arm, inside of the leg.outside of the leg, because that tells us possibly.which nerve is actually being pinched.We know it's all mapped out where L three.the nerve coming out of L three and your Lumbar spine.where that goes down in your leg, you know what?.L five goes down the top of your foot.if you feel symptoms there.Right.So where you're having the pain.it could be where you're having the pinch nerve.but quite often it isn't.Right.And it's a real, it's a real treasure hunt here.Kind of trying to figure out investigative job.trying to figure out where.the problem is coming from.So let's talk about a couple, some.of the common areas where you might.have a pinch nerve.Nancy, could we have the spine right away?.Who's catching.There ya go.Okay We got our spine here.Spine.This is really where a partial head here.These are the bones that stack.up to make your back, you know,.within the bones itself there's a canal.and that's your spinal cord.And coming off the spinal cord are these nerves.All right these are the nerves.that can get compressed or pinched.Right.All right One of the common areas.that can get pinched is right.when it's coming outta these holes here,.the right right in that spot here,.as you get older you want to zoom in.and Brad, can you kind of point out?.Sure Yep.Okay So now the nerves remember.are not a half inch long like I'm here.They, they actually, the nerves.are go down into your arm the nerves.and this area will wrap around your chest.and the ones out here go down to your legs.But here's that whole valve talking.about where the nerve exits.from the spinal cord directly connected.to the spinal cord.As you get older there,.your neck will become arthritic.Sure.I can tell you from age 20 on it's deteriorating.these holes start to get smaller just.from arthritic changes.Right.And so there's less room.for the nerve to get out.If let's say the nerve gets a little bit.swollen suddenly there's, there's no room.for it to come out and it's getting pinched right.Where as it comes out.Sure.Less common in the lumbar area.cause these holes are quite bigger.but what can happen in the lumbar area?.Brad, bigger, the holes there are larger,.Larger.Okay The holes there are larger.Okay.And so there's a lot more room.for the nerves to come out.So it's unlikely that you're gonna get pinching.from the hole itself in the lumbar area.but you can get a disc problem.And here's a nice model.You talk about a slip disc.That's really not correct is a herniated disc.and a herniated disc, you can see here.Can you zoom in on this pretty good?.The bald dried here?.Why don't you show a healthy disc first, Brad.This is a healthy disc.Sure That's a good idea.A healthy disc is kept in here.Usually a little thicker in the front.a little narrower in the back and.It's all contained it.Exactly.Boy We know we've got another video.on some details on the disc without getting into.that the disc will actually bulge out.Put Pressure.Yeah.Put pressure on the, on a specific nerve.And that nerve will send symptoms wherever.that nerve tracks.And here they go down into the leg.And that the.the pain that you get often.from nerve pain is off quite often.Some of the worst pain you'll have.Yeah It is.Nerve pain is not fun.Exactly.I know when you can tell.when someone's drilling into a nerve.that, you know that's the way they'll.make you talk, If they wanna torture you.So the other thing that could be causing pressure.on a nerve is even scar tissue.Sure.If you a nerve, the nerve.can actually get scarred down.and when you move it,.it actually puts pressure on it.Cause increased pain.We've had sometimes I've had people that have.had scar tissue on a nerve in their back.And we actually had to stretch that nerve.Right.To break up that scar tissue.After a surgery sometimes you.can have scarred filled up or an injury.So the other thing is, as the nerves come out.anywhere along this path,.they can get pinched somewhere.Sure.And the common one that many of you probably.know about is carpal tunnel syndrome.and there's a band or ligament.that goes across here and the.the nerve crosses underneath that ligament.And especially if you do a lot.of repetitive activities like typing.or where you're bending your wrist this way.or this way or.Factory type work.Or factory type work that ligament.can thicken up and there's less room.for the nerve to go under.And that's where you can get pinched nerve also.So the job of the physician or doctor.or physical therapist is to figure out.where along this path for your arms,.are you getting a pinch nerve or where along.you know your legs, where from the back to the legs.are you getting a pinched nerve.Right.And which we usually call sciatica.Sure.The other thing we thought.we talked about a couple fun ones, right?.Brad, there's some names out there for.for nerves that get pinched.And these are the ones that are generally more.of a temporary pinch.but one is called Saturday night palsy.And this is apparently what happens.if you fall asleep like.on a bar or over the, over a chair like that.you get pressure on the back of your nerve, your.your arm there, that's a radial nerve palsy.and you wake up and you're so drunk.that you, you don't wake up at all.You wake up in your arms,.you can't move your arms.They're they're they're yeah.They, they, they cut off so much that the.the nerves cannot fire the muscles.It's I've never experienced that.You don't even know what that would be.But another one would be.honeymoon Phoneymoon palsy.You fall asleep and your honey's.on your arm like this.Yeah This looks like your honey.Yeah This is my honey.And all night long, you're afraid.to get away from her.And there's a joke too, about nodding off.That also causes a palsy in your arm.Another one is, could be related.as a handcuff neuropathy.I wouldn't about that either.That are too tight.they can actually put pressure on the nerves.And the last one we're gonna mention is,.is a crutch palsy.I wish we had some crutches here but.that's why when we, when you use crutches we try.to teach you that you're really not trying to.to hang on them or, or lean on to them onto them.It should not put pressure to your armpit,.Right.It should be going through your arm.You got a big plexus of nerves coming.through your armpit here and into the arm.And if you lean on those crutches.they're actually going to cause.the crutch pad is not made for padding.to put up-.The pressure should be on your.your palms.Right.And squeezing the, the crutches in.So that they're-.I got another one though Bob.I can show you this one,.Another palsy?.Yeah I don't know what you call it,.but she can't see me.Oh.If I go to sleep on my stomach.which I don't much anymore.Cause I bother with my back.But if I sleep like this.I've waken up and hours are completely.sleep completely I can't do anything.I've already done this.And I bit my hand, ah, like you.can't feel those thing.It's pretty fun.Oh, I actually, I woke up one time.and the alarm's going off in both arms like that.Yeah And I'm going like this, turn, the knock.turn the alarm off.That's kinda fun.The other one that is a common one that is.you're driving along.This is why you shouldn't wear your wallet.and your back pocket.Yeah.You're gonna -you're gonna actually.pressure on your CIC nerve.And I had it one time where my foot fell asleep.and I was hitting the brake.and I couldn't feel it.And I'm coming to a stop light and I.I can't stop the car because I'm pushing as well.All my might.So I stopped wearing my wallet in the back.Yeah.Back pocket there.That's that big thick wallet.Well, I just got papers in it.There there's nothing else in it.Believe me.All right","{'(10.607,

6kQEDRQdJZ8,How to identify if you may have honeymoon palsy?,"(449, 469)", You dont even know what that would be.But another one would be.honeymoon P honeymoon palsy.You fall asleep and your honeys.on your arm like this. Yeah This looks like your honey. Yeah This is my honey.And all night long youre afraid.to get away from her.And theres a joke too about nodding off.That also causes a palsy in your arm,"Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck physical therapist.And together we are the most famous physical.therapists on the internet.In our opinion of course.Think fast Today we're gonna talk.about what is a pinch nerve.A lot of people get a pinch nerve.or they get a pain.And they say they've been diagnosed.and they say, well somewhere you.have a pinch nerve.We're gonna kind of go talk.about where you can pinch a nerve.and what it is and, and what,.what symptoms it gives you.Sure.So first let's talk about the symptoms.What are the things you're gonna feel when.you have a pinched nerve?.One thing you might have quite often is pain.'cause you're getting compression.on a nerve is what is is happening.And the nerves are coming out.from your spinal cord and going.from the spinal cord into your arms.and into your legs.And in this area, they wrap around the trunk.Sure They wrap around the trunk.so you can get actually pain.or a compression of a nerve anywhere.in the body in essence.Right.So let's start talking.about some of the common symptoms you're gonna feel.First off, you can have pain.you can have radiating pain, pain,.that's going down.Right?.The extremity, you can have-.Numbness, burning, tingling.A lot of times, people in the clinic.I know that when they got it in their low back.and it's going down their leg, I just.had a woman yesterday.It feels real tight, a pulling sensation.Right.It's hard to describe a nerve pain compared.to like a pain where you're, you know,.if you break your arm.or a mechanical pain is very clear.where nerve pain is also.It can be ever changing too.Yep, exactly weird.Quite often when people start getting.and that's a good way to put it.A lot of times when people come in.they're having really strange symptoms.I often go, you know what?.That sounds like nerve pain, 'cause nerve pain.It just gives you really weird things.You can get like hot and cold sensations.Sure Yeah, exactly.Pins and needles.If you start getting weakness in the arm,.that's often quite often can be-.That's getting more serious.That's getting more serious spasms.that can be from from nerve compression too.And, and one thing I wanna point out.as a therapist or a physician.or a chiropractor, we pay attention.to where that you feel the pain, you know,.is it on the front of your arm.or the back of the arm, inside of the leg.outside of the leg, because that tells us possibly.which nerve is actually being pinched.We know it's all mapped out where L three.the nerve coming out of L three and your Lumbar spine.where that goes down in your leg, you know what?.L five goes down the top of your foot.if you feel symptoms there.Right.So where you're having the pain.it could be where you're having the pinch nerve.but quite often it isn't.Right.And it's a real, it's a real treasure hunt here.Kind of trying to figure out investigative job.trying to figure out where.the problem is coming from.So let's talk about a couple, some.of the common areas where you might.have a pinch nerve.Nancy, could we have the spine right away?.Who's catching.There ya go.Okay We got our spine here.Spine.This is really where a partial head here.These are the bones that stack.up to make your back, you know,.within the bones itself there's a canal.and that's your spinal cord.And coming off the spinal cord are these nerves.All right these are the nerves.that can get compressed or pinched.Right.All right One of the common areas.that can get pinched is right.when it's coming outta these holes here,.the right right in that spot here,.as you get older you want to zoom in.and Brad, can you kind of point out?.Sure Yep.Okay So now the nerves remember.are not a half inch long like I'm here.They, they actually, the nerves.are go down into your arm the nerves.and this area will wrap around your chest.and the ones out here go down to your legs.But here's that whole valve talking.about where the nerve exits.from the spinal cord directly connected.to the spinal cord.As you get older there,.your neck will become arthritic.Sure.I can tell you from age 20 on it's deteriorating.these holes start to get smaller just.from arthritic changes.Right.And so there's less room.for the nerve to get out.If let's say the nerve gets a little bit.swollen suddenly there's, there's no room.for it to come out and it's getting pinched right.Where as it comes out.Sure.Less common in the lumbar area.cause these holes are quite bigger.but what can happen in the lumbar area?.Brad, bigger, the holes there are larger,.Larger.Okay The holes there are larger.Okay.And so there's a lot more room.for the nerves to come out.So it's unlikely that you're gonna get pinching.from the hole itself in the lumbar area.but you can get a disc problem.And here's a nice model.You talk about a slip disc.That's really not correct is a herniated disc.and a herniated disc, you can see here.Can you zoom in on this pretty good?.The bald dried here?.Why don't you show a healthy disc first, Brad.This is a healthy disc.Sure That's a good idea.A healthy disc is kept in here.Usually a little thicker in the front.a little narrower in the back and.It's all contained it.Exactly.Boy We know we've got another video.on some details on the disc without getting into.that the disc will actually bulge out.Put Pressure.Yeah.Put pressure on the, on a specific nerve.And that nerve will send symptoms wherever.that nerve tracks.And here they go down into the leg.And that the.the pain that you get often.from nerve pain is off quite often.Some of the worst pain you'll have.Yeah It is.Nerve pain is not fun.Exactly.I know when you can tell.when someone's drilling into a nerve.that, you know that's the way they'll.make you talk, If they wanna torture you.So the other thing that could be causing pressure.on a nerve is even scar tissue.Sure.If you a nerve, the nerve.can actually get scarred down.and when you move it,.it actually puts pressure on it.Cause increased pain.We've had sometimes I've had people that have.had scar tissue on a nerve in their back.And we actually had to stretch that nerve.Right.To break up that scar tissue.After a surgery sometimes you.can have scarred filled up or an injury.So the other thing is, as the nerves come out.anywhere along this path,.they can get pinched somewhere.Sure.And the common one that many of you probably.know about is carpal tunnel syndrome.and there's a band or ligament.that goes across here and the.the nerve crosses underneath that ligament.And especially if you do a lot.of repetitive activities like typing.or where you're bending your wrist this way.or this way or.Factory type work.Or factory type work that ligament.can thicken up and there's less room.for the nerve to go under.And that's where you can get pinched nerve also.So the job of the physician or doctor.or physical therapist is to figure out.where along this path for your arms,.are you getting a pinch nerve or where along.you know your legs, where from the back to the legs.are you getting a pinched nerve.Right.And which we usually call sciatica.Sure.The other thing we thought.we talked about a couple fun ones, right?.Brad, there's some names out there for.for nerves that get pinched.And these are the ones that are generally more.of a temporary pinch.but one is called Saturday night palsy.And this is apparently what happens.if you fall asleep like.on a bar or over the, over a chair like that.you get pressure on the back of your nerve, your.your arm there, that's a radial nerve palsy.and you wake up and you're so drunk.that you, you don't wake up at all.You wake up in your arms,.you can't move your arms.They're they're they're yeah.They, they, they cut off so much that the.the nerves cannot fire the muscles.It's I've never experienced that.You don't even know what that would be.But another one would be.honeymoon Phoneymoon palsy.You fall asleep and your honey's.on your arm like this.Yeah This looks like your honey.Yeah This is my honey.And all night long, you're afraid.to get away from her.And there's a joke too, about nodding off.That also causes a palsy in your arm.Another one is, could be related.as a handcuff neuropathy.I wouldn't about that either.That are too tight.they can actually put pressure on the nerves.And the last one we're gonna mention is,.is a crutch palsy.I wish we had some crutches here but.that's why when we, when you use crutches we try.to teach you that you're really not trying to.to hang on them or, or lean on to them onto them.It should not put pressure to your armpit,.Right.It should be going through your arm.You got a big plexus of nerves coming.through your armpit here and into the arm.And if you lean on those crutches.they're actually going to cause.the crutch pad is not made for padding.to put up-.The pressure should be on your.your palms.Right.And squeezing the, the crutches in.So that they're-.I got another one though Bob.I can show you this one,.Another palsy?.Yeah I don't know what you call it,.but she can't see me.Oh.If I go to sleep on my stomach.which I don't much anymore.Cause I bother with my back.But if I sleep like this.I've waken up and hours are completely.sleep completely I can't do anything.I've already done this.And I bit my hand, ah, like you.can't feel those thing.It's pretty fun.Oh, I actually, I woke up one time.and the alarm's going off in both arms like that.Yeah And I'm going like this, turn, the knock.turn the alarm off.That's kinda fun.The other one that is a common one that is.you're driving along.This is why you shouldn't wear your wallet.and your back pocket.Yeah.You're gonna -you're gonna actually.pressure on your CIC nerve.And I had it one time where my foot fell asleep.and I was hitting the brake.and I couldn't feel it.And I'm coming to a stop light and I.I can't stop the car because I'm pushing as well.All my might.So I stopped wearing my wallet in the back.Yeah.Back pocket there.That's that big thick wallet.Well, I just got papers in it.There there's nothing else in it.Believe me.All right","{'(10.607, 11.885)':  'All right', '(155.634, 156.46699999999998)':  'Right', '(240.2, 241.79)':

6kQEDRQdJZ8,How to identify if you may have handcuff neuropathy?,"(470, 480)",That also causes a palsy in your arm.Another one is could be related.as a handcuff neuropathy. I wouldnt about that either. That are too tight.they can actually put pressure on the nerves,"Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck physical therapist.And together we are the most famous physical.therapists on the internet.In our opinion of course.Think fast Today we're gonna talk.about what is a pinch nerve.A lot of people get a pinch nerve.or they get a pain.And they say they've been diagnosed.and they say, well somewhere you.have a pinch nerve.We're gonna kind of go talk.about where you can pinch a nerve.and what it is and, and what,.what symptoms it gives you.Sure.So first let's talk about the symptoms.What are the things you're gonna feel when.you have a pinched nerve?.One thing you might have quite often is pain.'cause you're getting compression.on a nerve is what is is happening.And the nerves are coming out.from your spinal cord and going.from the spinal cord into your arms.and into your legs.And in this area, they wrap around the trunk.Sure They wrap around the trunk.so you can get actually pain.or a compression of a nerve anywhere.in the body in essence.Right.So let's start talking.about some of the common symptoms you're gonna feel.First off, you can have pain.you can have radiating pain, pain,.that's going down.Right?.The extremity, you can have-.Numbness, burning, tingling.A lot of times, people in the clinic.I know that when they got it in their low back.and it's going down their leg, I just.had a woman yesterday.It feels real tight, a pulling sensation.Right.It's hard to describe a nerve pain compared.to like a pain where you're, you know,.if you break your arm.or a mechanical pain is very clear.where nerve pain is also.It can be ever changing too.Yep, exactly weird.Quite often when people start getting.and that's a good way to put it.A lot of times when people come in.they're having really strange symptoms.I often go, you know what?.That sounds like nerve pain, 'cause nerve pain.It just gives you really weird things.You can get like hot and cold sensations.Sure Yeah, exactly.Pins and needles.If you start getting weakness in the arm,.that's often quite often can be-.That's getting more serious.That's getting more serious spasms.that can be from from nerve compression too.And, and one thing I wanna point out.as a therapist or a physician.or a chiropractor, we pay attention.to where that you feel the pain, you know,.is it on the front of your arm.or the back of the arm, inside of the leg.outside of the leg, because that tells us possibly.which nerve is actually being pinched.We know it's all mapped out where L three.the nerve coming out of L three and your Lumbar spine.where that goes down in your leg, you know what?.L five goes down the top of your foot.if you feel symptoms there.Right.So where you're having the pain.it could be where you're having the pinch nerve.but quite often it isn't.Right.And it's a real, it's a real treasure hunt here.Kind of trying to figure out investigative job.trying to figure out where.the problem is coming from.So let's talk about a couple, some.of the common areas where you might.have a pinch nerve.Nancy, could we have the spine right away?.Who's catching.There ya go.Okay We got our spine here.Spine.This is really where a partial head here.These are the bones that stack.up to make your back, you know,.within the bones itself there's a canal.and that's your spinal cord.And coming off the spinal cord are these nerves.All right these are the nerves.that can get compressed or pinched.Right.All right One of the common areas.that can get pinched is right.when it's coming outta these holes here,.the right right in that spot here,.as you get older you want to zoom in.and Brad, can you kind of point out?.Sure Yep.Okay So now the nerves remember.are not a half inch long like I'm here.They, they actually, the nerves.are go down into your arm the nerves.and this area will wrap around your chest.and the ones out here go down to your legs.But here's that whole valve talking.about where the nerve exits.from the spinal cord directly connected.to the spinal cord.As you get older there,.your neck will become arthritic.Sure.I can tell you from age 20 on it's deteriorating.these holes start to get smaller just.from arthritic changes.Right.And so there's less room.for the nerve to get out.If let's say the nerve gets a little bit.swollen suddenly there's, there's no room.for it to come out and it's getting pinched right.Where as it comes out.Sure.Less common in the lumbar area.cause these holes are quite bigger.but what can happen in the lumbar area?.Brad, bigger, the holes there are larger,.Larger.Okay The holes there are larger.Okay.And so there's a lot more room.for the nerves to come out.So it's unlikely that you're gonna get pinching.from the hole itself in the lumbar area.but you can get a disc problem.And here's a nice model.You talk about a slip disc.That's really not correct is a herniated disc.and a herniated disc, you can see here.Can you zoom in on this pretty good?.The bald dried here?.Why don't you show a healthy disc first, Brad.This is a healthy disc.Sure That's a good idea.A healthy disc is kept in here.Usually a little thicker in the front.a little narrower in the back and.It's all contained it.Exactly.Boy We know we've got another video.on some details on the disc without getting into.that the disc will actually bulge out.Put Pressure.Yeah.Put pressure on the, on a specific nerve.And that nerve will send symptoms wherever.that nerve tracks.And here they go down into the leg.And that the.the pain that you get often.from nerve pain is off quite often.Some of the worst pain you'll have.Yeah It is.Nerve pain is not fun.Exactly.I know when you can tell.when someone's drilling into a nerve.that, you know that's the way they'll.make you talk, If they wanna torture you.So the other thing that could be causing pressure.on a nerve is even scar tissue.Sure.If you a nerve, the nerve.can actually get scarred down.and when you move it,.it actually puts pressure on it.Cause increased pain.We've had sometimes I've had people that have.had scar tissue on a nerve in their back.And we actually had to stretch that nerve.Right.To break up that scar tissue.After a surgery sometimes you.can have scarred filled up or an injury.So the other thing is, as the nerves come out.anywhere along this path,.they can get pinched somewhere.Sure.And the common one that many of you probably.know about is carpal tunnel syndrome.and there's a band or ligament.that goes across here and the.the nerve crosses underneath that ligament.And especially if you do a lot.of repetitive activities like typing.or where you're bending your wrist this way.or this way or.Factory type work.Or factory type work that ligament.can thicken up and there's less room.for the nerve to go under.And that's where you can get pinched nerve also.So the job of the physician or doctor.or physical therapist is to figure out.where along this path for your arms,.are you getting a pinch nerve or where along.you know your legs, where from the back to the legs.are you getting a pinched nerve.Right.And which we usually call sciatica.Sure.The other thing we thought.we talked about a couple fun ones, right?.Brad, there's some names out there for.for nerves that get pinched.And these are the ones that are generally more.of a temporary pinch.but one is called Saturday night palsy.And this is apparently what happens.if you fall asleep like.on a bar or over the, over a chair like that.you get pressure on the back of your nerve, your.your arm there, that's a radial nerve palsy.and you wake up and you're so drunk.that you, you don't wake up at all.You wake up in your arms,.you can't move your arms.They're they're they're yeah.They, they, they cut off so much that the.the nerves cannot fire the muscles.It's I've never experienced that.You don't even know what that would be.But another one would be.honeymoon Phoneymoon palsy.You fall asleep and your honey's.on your arm like this.Yeah This looks like your honey.Yeah This is my honey.And all night long, you're afraid.to get away from her.And there's a joke too, about nodding off.That also causes a palsy in your arm.Another one is, could be related.as a handcuff neuropathy.I wouldn't about that either.That are too tight.they can actually put pressure on the nerves.And the last one we're gonna mention is,.is a crutch palsy.I wish we had some crutches here but.that's why when we, when you use crutches we try.to teach you that you're really not trying to.to hang on them or, or lean on to them onto them.It should not put pressure to your armpit,.Right.It should be going through your arm.You got a big plexus of nerves coming.through your armpit here and into the arm.And if you lean on those crutches.they're actually going to cause.the crutch pad is not made for padding.to put up-.The pressure should be on your.your palms.Right.And squeezing the, the crutches in.So that they're-.I got another one though Bob.I can show you this one,.Another palsy?.Yeah I don't know what you call it,.but she can't see me.Oh.If I go to sleep on my stomach.which I don't much anymore.Cause I bother with my back.But if I sleep like this.I've waken up and hours are completely.sleep completely I can't do anything.I've already done this.And I bit my hand, ah, like you.can't feel those thing.It's pretty fun.Oh, I actually, I woke up one time.and the alarm's going off in both arms like that.Yeah And I'm going like this, turn, the knock.turn the alarm off.That's kinda fun.The other one that is a common one that is.you're driving along.This is why you shouldn't wear your wallet.and your back pocket.Yeah.You're gonna -you're gonna actually.pressure on your CIC nerve.And I had it one time where my foot fell asleep.and I was hitting the brake.and I couldn't feel it.And I'm coming to a stop light and I.I can't stop the car because I'm pushing as well.All my might.So I stopped wearing my wallet in the back.Yeah.Back pocket there.That's that big thick wallet.Well, I just got papers in it.There there's nothing else in it.Believe me.All right","{'(10.607,

6kQEDRQdJZ8,How to identify if you may have crutch palsy?,"(481, 514)",they can actually put pressure on the nerves.And the last one were gonna mention is.is a crutch palsy.I wish we had some crutches here but.thats why when we when you use crutches we try.to teach you that youre really not trying to.to hang on them or or lean on to them onto them. It should not put pressure to your armpit. Right. It should be going through your arm. You got a big plexus of nerves coming.through your armpit here and into the arm.And if you lean on those crutches.theyre actually going to cause.the crutch pad is not made for padding.to put up. The pressure should be on your.your palms. Right. And squeezing the the crutches in,"Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck physical therapist.And together we are the most famous physical.therapists on the internet.In our opinion of course.Think fast Today we're gonna talk.about what is a pinch nerve.A lot of people get a pinch nerve.or they get a pain.And they say they've been diagnosed.and they say, well somewhere you.have a pinch nerve.We're gonna kind of go talk.about where you can pinch a nerve.and what it is and, and what,.what symptoms it gives you.Sure.So first let's talk about the symptoms.What are the things you're gonna feel when.you have a pinched nerve?.One thing you might have quite often is pain.'cause you're getting compression.on a nerve is what is is happening.And the nerves are coming out.from your spinal cord and going.from the spinal cord into your arms.and into your legs.And in this area, they wrap around the trunk.Sure They wrap around the trunk.so you can get actually pain.or a compression of a nerve anywhere.in the body in essence.Right.So let's start talking.about some of the common symptoms you're gonna feel.First off, you can have pain.you can have radiating pain, pain,.that's going down.Right?.The extremity, you can have-.Numbness, burning, tingling.A lot of times, people in the clinic.I know that when they got it in their low back.and it's going down their leg, I just.had a woman yesterday.It feels real tight, a pulling sensation.Right.It's hard to describe a nerve pain compared.to like a pain where you're, you know,.if you break your arm.or a mechanical pain is very clear.where nerve pain is also.It can be ever changing too.Yep, exactly weird.Quite often when people start getting.and that's a good way to put it.A lot of times when people come in.they're having really strange symptoms.I often go, you know what?.That sounds like nerve pain, 'cause nerve pain.It just gives you really weird things.You can get like hot and cold sensations.Sure Yeah, exactly.Pins and needles.If you start getting weakness in the arm,.that's often quite often can be-.That's getting more serious.That's getting more serious spasms.that can be from from nerve compression too.And, and one thing I wanna point out.as a therapist or a physician.or a chiropractor, we pay attention.to where that you feel the pain, you know,.is it on the front of your arm.or the back of the arm, inside of the leg.outside of the leg, because that tells us possibly.which nerve is actually being pinched.We know it's all mapped out where L three.the nerve coming out of L three and your Lumbar spine.where that goes down in your leg, you know what?.L five goes down the top of your foot.if you feel symptoms there.Right.So where you're having the pain.it could be where you're having the pinch nerve.but quite often it isn't.Right.And it's a real, it's a real treasure hunt here.Kind of trying to figure out investigative job.trying to figure out where.the problem is coming from.So let's talk about a couple, some.of the common areas where you might.have a pinch nerve.Nancy, could we have the spine right away?.Who's catching.There ya go.Okay We got our spine here.Spine.This is really where a partial head here.These are the bones that stack.up to make your back, you know,.within the bones itself there's a canal.and that's your spinal cord.And coming off the spinal cord are these nerves.All right these are the nerves.that can get compressed or pinched.Right.All right One of the common areas.that can get pinched is right.when it's coming outta these holes here,.the right right in that spot here,.as you get older you want to zoom in.and Brad, can you kind of point out?.Sure Yep.Okay So now the nerves remember.are not a half inch long like I'm here.They, they actually, the nerves.are go down into your arm the nerves.and this area will wrap around your chest.and the ones out here go down to your legs.But here's that whole valve talking.about where the nerve exits.from the spinal cord directly connected.to the spinal cord.As you get older there,.your neck will become arthritic.Sure.I can tell you from age 20 on it's deteriorating.these holes start to get smaller just.from arthritic changes.Right.And so there's less room.for the nerve to get out.If let's say the nerve gets a little bit.swollen suddenly there's, there's no room.for it to come out and it's getting pinched right.Where as it comes out.Sure.Less common in the lumbar area.cause these holes are quite bigger.but what can happen in the lumbar area?.Brad, bigger, the holes there are larger,.Larger.Okay The holes there are larger.Okay.And so there's a lot more room.for the nerves to come out.So it's unlikely that you're gonna get pinching.from the hole itself in the lumbar area.but you can get a disc problem.And here's a nice model.You talk about a slip disc.That's really not correct is a herniated disc.and a herniated disc, you can see here.Can you zoom in on this pretty good?.The bald dried here?.Why don't you show a healthy disc first, Brad.This is a healthy disc.Sure That's a good idea.A healthy disc is kept in here.Usually a little thicker in the front.a little narrower in the back and.It's all contained it.Exactly.Boy We know we've got another video.on some details on the disc without getting into.that the disc will actually bulge out.Put Pressure.Yeah.Put pressure on the, on a specific nerve.And that nerve will send symptoms wherever.that nerve tracks.And here they go down into the leg.And that the.the pain that you get often.from nerve pain is off quite often.Some of the worst pain you'll have.Yeah It is.Nerve pain is not fun.Exactly.I know when you can tell.when someone's drilling into a nerve.that, you know that's the way they'll.make you talk, If they wanna torture you.So the other thing that could be causing pressure.on a nerve is even scar tissue.Sure.If you a nerve, the nerve.can actually get scarred down.and when you move it,.it actually puts pressure on it.Cause increased pain.We've had sometimes I've had people that have.had scar tissue on a nerve in their back.And we actually had to stretch that nerve.Right.To break up that scar tissue.After a surgery sometimes you.can have scarred filled up or an injury.So the other thing is, as the nerves come out.anywhere along this path,.they can get pinched somewhere.Sure.And the common one that many of you probably.know about is carpal tunnel syndrome.and there's a band or ligament.that goes across here and the.the nerve crosses underneath that ligament.And especially if you do a lot.of repetitive activities like typing.or where you're bending your wrist this way.or this way or.Factory type work.Or factory type work that ligament.can thicken up and there's less room.for the nerve to go under.And that's where you can get pinched nerve also.So the job of the physician or doctor.or physical therapist is to figure out.where along this path for your arms,.are you getting a pinch nerve or where along.you know your legs, where from the back to the legs.are you getting a pinched nerve.Right.And which we usually call sciatica.Sure.The other thing we thought.we talked about a couple fun ones, right?.Brad, there's some names out there for.for nerves that get pinched.And these are the ones that are generally more.of a temporary pinch.but one is called Saturday night palsy.And this is apparently what happens.if you fall asleep like.on a bar or over the, over a chair like that.you get pressure on the back of your nerve, your.your arm there, that's a radial nerve palsy.and you wake up and you're so drunk.that you, you don't wake up at all.You wake up in your arms,.you can't move your arms.They're they're they're yeah.They, they, they cut off so much that the.the nerves cannot fire the muscles.It's I've never experienced that.You don't even know what that would be.But another one would be.honeymoon Phoneymoon palsy.You fall asleep and your honey's.on your arm like this.Yeah This looks like your honey.Yeah This is my honey.And all night long, you're afraid.to get away from her.And there's a joke too, about nodding off.That also causes a palsy in your arm.Another one is, could be related.as a handcuff neuropathy.I wouldn't about that either.That are too tight.they can actually put pressure on the nerves.And the last one we're gonna mention is,.is a crutch palsy.I wish we had some crutches here but.that's why when we, when you use crutches we try.to teach you that you're really not trying to.to hang on them or, or lean on to them onto them.It should not put pressure to your armpit,.Right.It should be going through your arm.You got a big plexus of nerves coming.through your armpit here and into the arm.And if you lean on those crutches.they're actually going to cause.the crutch pad is not made for padding.to put up-.The pressure should be on your.your palms.Right.And squeezing the, the crutches in.So that they're-.I got another one though Bob.I can show you this one,.Another palsy?.Yeah I don't know what you call it,.but she can't see me.Oh.If I go to sleep on my stomach.which I don't much anymore.Cause I bother with my back.But if I sleep like this.I've waken up and hours are completely.sleep completely I can't do anything.I've already done this.And I bit my hand, ah, like you.can't feel those thing.It's pretty fun.Oh, I actually, I woke up one time.and the alarm's going off in both arms like that.Yeah And I'm going like this, turn, the knock.turn the alarm off.That's kinda fun.The other one that is a common one that is.you're driving along.This is why you shouldn't wear your wallet.and your back pocket.Yeah.You're gonna -you're gonna actually.pressure on your CIC nerve.And I had it one time where my foot fell asleep.and I was hitting the brake.and I couldn't feel it.And I'm coming to a stop light and I.I can't stop the car because I'm pushing as well.All my might.So I stopped wearing my wallet in the back.Yeah.Back pocket there.That's that big thick wallet.Well, I just got papers in it.There there's nothing else in it.Believe me.All right","{'(10.607,

6kQEDRQdJZ8,How to prevent your foot from falling asleep while you drive?,"(552, 574)",The other one that is a common one that is.youre driving along.This is why you shouldnt wear your wallet.and your back pocket. Yeah. Youre gonna youre gonna actually.pressure on your CIC nerve.And I had it one time where my foot fell asleep.and I was hitting the brake.and I couldnt feel it.And Im coming to a stop light and I.I cant stop the car because Im pushing as well.All my might.So I stopped wearing my wallet in the back. Yeah,"Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck physical therapist.And together we are the most famous physical.therapists on the internet.In our opinion of course.Think fast Today we're gonna talk.about what is a pinch nerve.A lot of people get a pinch nerve.or they get a pain.And they say they've been diagnosed.and they say, well somewhere you.have a pinch nerve.We're gonna kind of go talk.about where you can pinch a nerve.and what it is and, and what,.what symptoms it gives you.Sure.So first let's talk about the symptoms.What are the things you're gonna feel when.you have a pinched nerve?.One thing you might have quite often is pain.'cause you're getting compression.on a nerve is what is is happening.And the nerves are coming out.from your spinal cord and going.from the spinal cord into your arms.and into your legs.And in this area, they wrap around the trunk.Sure They wrap around the trunk.so you can get actually pain.or a compression of a nerve anywhere.in the body in essence.Right.So let's start talking.about some of the common symptoms you're gonna feel.First off, you can have pain.you can have radiating pain, pain,.that's going down.Right?.The extremity, you can have-.Numbness, burning, tingling.A lot of times, people in the clinic.I know that when they got it in their low back.and it's going down their leg, I just.had a woman yesterday.It feels real tight, a pulling sensation.Right.It's hard to describe a nerve pain compared.to like a pain where you're, you know,.if you break your arm.or a mechanical pain is very clear.where nerve pain is also.It can be ever changing too.Yep, exactly weird.Quite often when people start getting.and that's a good way to put it.A lot of times when people come in.they're having really strange symptoms.I often go, you know what?.That sounds like nerve pain, 'cause nerve pain.It just gives you really weird things.You can get like hot and cold sensations.Sure Yeah, exactly.Pins and needles.If you start getting weakness in the arm,.that's often quite often can be-.That's getting more serious.That's getting more serious spasms.that can be from from nerve compression too.And, and one thing I wanna point out.as a therapist or a physician.or a chiropractor, we pay attention.to where that you feel the pain, you know,.is it on the front of your arm.or the back of the arm, inside of the leg.outside of the leg, because that tells us possibly.which nerve is actually being pinched.We know it's all mapped out where L three.the nerve coming out of L three and your Lumbar spine.where that goes down in your leg, you know what?.L five goes down the top of your foot.if you feel symptoms there.Right.So where you're having the pain.it could be where you're having the pinch nerve.but quite often it isn't.Right.And it's a real, it's a real treasure hunt here.Kind of trying to figure out investigative job.trying to figure out where.the problem is coming from.So let's talk about a couple, some.of the common areas where you might.have a pinch nerve.Nancy, could we have the spine right away?.Who's catching.There ya go.Okay We got our spine here.Spine.This is really where a partial head here.These are the bones that stack.up to make your back, you know,.within the bones itself there's a canal.and that's your spinal cord.And coming off the spinal cord are these nerves.All right these are the nerves.that can get compressed or pinched.Right.All right One of the common areas.that can get pinched is right.when it's coming outta these holes here,.the right right in that spot here,.as you get older you want to zoom in.and Brad, can you kind of point out?.Sure Yep.Okay So now the nerves remember.are not a half inch long like I'm here.They, they actually, the nerves.are go down into your arm the nerves.and this area will wrap around your chest.and the ones out here go down to your legs.But here's that whole valve talking.about where the nerve exits.from the spinal cord directly connected.to the spinal cord.As you get older there,.your neck will become arthritic.Sure.I can tell you from age 20 on it's deteriorating.these holes start to get smaller just.from arthritic changes.Right.And so there's less room.for the nerve to get out.If let's say the nerve gets a little bit.swollen suddenly there's, there's no room.for it to come out and it's getting pinched right.Where as it comes out.Sure.Less common in the lumbar area.cause these holes are quite bigger.but what can happen in the lumbar area?.Brad, bigger, the holes there are larger,.Larger.Okay The holes there are larger.Okay.And so there's a lot more room.for the nerves to come out.So it's unlikely that you're gonna get pinching.from the hole itself in the lumbar area.but you can get a disc problem.And here's a nice model.You talk about a slip disc.That's really not correct is a herniated disc.and a herniated disc, you can see here.Can you zoom in on this pretty good?.The bald dried here?.Why don't you show a healthy disc first, Brad.This is a healthy disc.Sure That's a good idea.A healthy disc is kept in here.Usually a little thicker in the front.a little narrower in the back and.It's all contained it.Exactly.Boy We know we've got another video.on some details on the disc without getting into.that the disc will actually bulge out.Put Pressure.Yeah.Put pressure on the, on a specific nerve.And that nerve will send symptoms wherever.that nerve tracks.And here they go down into the leg.And that the.the pain that you get often.from nerve pain is off quite often.Some of the worst pain you'll have.Yeah It is.Nerve pain is not fun.Exactly.I know when you can tell.when someone's drilling into a nerve.that, you know that's the way they'll.make you talk, If they wanna torture you.So the other thing that could be causing pressure.on a nerve is even scar tissue.Sure.If you a nerve, the nerve.can actually get scarred down.and when you move it,.it actually puts pressure on it.Cause increased pain.We've had sometimes I've had people that have.had scar tissue on a nerve in their back.And we actually had to stretch that nerve.Right.To break up that scar tissue.After a surgery sometimes you.can have scarred filled up or an injury.So the other thing is, as the nerves come out.anywhere along this path,.they can get pinched somewhere.Sure.And the common one that many of you probably.know about is carpal tunnel syndrome.and there's a band or ligament.that goes across here and the.the nerve crosses underneath that ligament.And especially if you do a lot.of repetitive activities like typing.or where you're bending your wrist this way.or this way or.Factory type work.Or factory type work that ligament.can thicken up and there's less room.for the nerve to go under.And that's where you can get pinched nerve also.So the job of the physician or doctor.or physical therapist is to figure out.where along this path for your arms,.are you getting a pinch nerve or where along.you know your legs, where from the back to the legs.are you getting a pinched nerve.Right.And which we usually call sciatica.Sure.The other thing we thought.we talked about a couple fun ones, right?.Brad, there's some names out there for.for nerves that get pinched.And these are the ones that are generally more.of a temporary pinch.but one is called Saturday night palsy.And this is apparently what happens.if you fall asleep like.on a bar or over the, over a chair like that.you get pressure on the back of your nerve, your.your arm there, that's a radial nerve palsy.and you wake up and you're so drunk.that you, you don't wake up at all.You wake up in your arms,.you can't move your arms.They're they're they're yeah.They, they, they cut off so much that the.the nerves cannot fire the muscles.It's I've never experienced that.You don't even know what that would be.But another one would be.honeymoon Phoneymoon palsy.You fall asleep and your honey's.on your arm like this.Yeah This looks like your honey.Yeah This is my honey.And all night long, you're afraid.to get away from her.And there's a joke too, about nodding off.That also causes a palsy in your arm.Another one is, could be related.as a handcuff neuropathy.I wouldn't about that either.That are too tight.they can actually put pressure on the nerves.And the last one we're gonna mention is,.is a crutch palsy.I wish we had some crutches here but.that's why when we, when you use crutches we try.to teach you that you're really not trying to.to hang on them or, or lean on to them onto them.It should not put pressure to your armpit,.Right.It should be going through your arm.You got a big plexus of nerves coming.through your armpit here and into the arm.And if you lean on those crutches.they're actually going to cause.the crutch pad is not made for padding.to put up-.The pressure should be on your.your palms.Right.And squeezing the, the crutches in.So that they're-.I got another one though Bob.I can show you this one,.Another palsy?.Yeah I don't know what you call it,.but she can't see me.Oh.If I go to sleep on my stomach.which I don't much anymore.Cause I bother with my back.But if I sleep like this.I've waken up and hours are completely.sleep completely I can't do anything.I've already done this.And I bit my hand, ah, like you.can't feel those thing.It's pretty fun.Oh, I actually, I woke up one time.and the alarm's going off in both arms like that.Yeah And I'm going like this, turn, the knock.turn the alarm off.That's kinda fun.The other one that is a common one that is.you're driving along.This is why you shouldn't wear your wallet.and your back pocket.Yeah.You're gonna -you're gonna actually.pressure on your CIC nerve.And I had it one time where my foot fell asleep.and I was hitting the brake.and I couldn't feel it.And I'm coming to a stop light and I.I can't stop the car because I'm pushing as well.All my might.So I stopped wearing my wallet in the back.Yeah.Back pocket there.That's that big thick wallet.Well, I just got papers in it.There there's nothing else in it.Believe me.All right","{'(10.607, 11.885)':  'All right', '(155.634, 156.46699999999998)':  'Right', '(240.2, 241.79)':

0dr5yuoBOF4,How do i apply pressure dressing on my leg?,"(206, 234)",all right so were gonna say that the.injury is here to my upper extremity.this is where the wounds gonna go here.so this is the wound and cut it right.here cut and then wrap it as you come.around if youll pull more pressure.tight pull around pull and honestly.chilling my legs kind of throbbing.already so has a little bit of velcro.type your fill here.slap it on and its secured,hey welcome to another video from skinny.Matic in this video I want to show you a.couple different pressure bandage trauma.dressings that you may see in my kit you.may see in some other kits on the market.so I just want to kind of demonstrate.them open them up and show you what.they're useful so take a look at the.outside the package here this is the.six-inch version here this is a 4-inch.version the four-inch version is what.you're gonna see in my skinny minute.pocket kit and I did include the.six-inch version in my new kit which is.the skinny medic essentials kit so we.take a look at the outside the package.here same thing with the rest of North.Americans gear you have red pull tabs.here so either side can pull so that way.you kind of get a visual of what you're.gonna grab ahold of so it's got some.directions a little hard to see because.everything's shrink wrapped airtight but.we're gonna open up and show you how to.use it here so open up pull the red tab.here then your compression bandage comes.right out so same thing with a 4-inch.version here pops right out so once we.get them open you can see the size.comparison here obvious it's a six inch.or four inch version so this one up here.is your Israeli bandage this is when you.are probably most familiar with there's.some similarities to these products and.then there's a difference and I'm going.to show you the similarities and not.show you the difference between these.products and the Israeli bandage so as.we roll the product out this is our.bandage here this is where we actually.put the wound on the extremity abdominal.area even a chest area so you can head.pretty much head to toe you can use this.bandage as a bandage so this is where.the wound would go here and then the.unroll and then there's where the wound.would go here so you do note that you.get a larger surface area with a 6-inch.bandage than the 4-inch bandage as I.brought the Israeli bandage here you can.see this is the area or we would put the.wound and then we're going to course.wrap it to create the pressures pressure.bandage trauma bandage this is what.these are called.so we have our bench here this is where.your wounds gonna go.when the other side was pretty good then.this rolls out and this is the stretchy.material so as we wrap it around the.wound and extremity you pull it tight.and that's what's going to create that.pressure that's going to hold pressure.for you so you don't sit there and have.to do it with your hand you can generate.a lot of pressure by wrapping it pulling.it and then wrap it again and pull it.again so you can generate a lot of.pressure with this 6-inch bandage you.could probably very easily make a.tourniquet out of this by pulling and.getting enough pressure on it you can.generate enough force to control.arterial bleeding we're just using a.pressure bandage now the problem is that.this is difficult to do one-handed if.you're doing on like a upper extremity.so doesn't make a good tourniquet there.but if you're applying someone else.you're applying to a lower extremity you.can make a tourniquet out of a pressure.bandage so then we roll out the Israeli.bandage here kind of the same style.material just got that stretch to it.there again you're pulling generating.pressure and then wrap and secure Nate.all right so we're gonna say that the.injury is here to my upper extremity.this is where the wounds gonna go here.so this is the wound and cut it right.here cut and then wrap it as you come.around if you'll pull more pressure.tight pull around pull and honestly.chilling my legs kind of throbbing.already so has a little bit of velcro.type your fill here.slap it on and it's secured.so the Rayleigh's bandage here same.thing wound on this side now this is.already put our wounds this is a big.difference in here now if you've got.this bracket here that you've got to.come through and then pull back so you.can generate that pressure pull back.pack it wrap it there again as you come.around if you pull here you can get some.more pressure there and then the Israeli.bandage has a clip here so you can find.like your last strand that you ran.through and clip it into place to secure.it so now both benches are secure so.there again you could use this on.extremities as well you can bandage.ahead there again if you've got a head.injury they're gonna bleed pretty loud.so then you can use this bandage here.drop around the head and then wrap it.around like you would any other Gaulle's.chest area as well it's gonna be kind of.hard for you to wrap it by myself you.can wrap it around the chest if you get.it like a flail chest being multiple.broken ribs here you can split that.using a bandage like this just be really.careful not to over compress the chest.sorry because your patient may have a.hard time breathing so if you had some.broken ribs you could use one of these.bandages to bandage those broken ribs.kind of split them in place abdominal.injuries the same thing you could wrap.this around your abdominal injury kind.of support the bleeding keep the.intestines everything like that on the.inside but you could use that just be.very careful not to over compress this.area because you made hurt the breathing.process as well the expansion of the.chest so I hope this video helps you.never know when you'll be the first.responder moving the drive gear and the.right training alright so if you're.stuck in out this long I'm gonna give.you a quick sneak peek up my new kit is.available on the website already have.not done a review video on this yet but.you can see cat tourniquet 6-inch.pressure bandage you get two compressed.galls you get two chest sales it's one.chest sale but there's a twin pack in.there you get an MPA you get an.emergency blanket like a Mylar blanket a.pair of gloves and you can get a bench.mate7 hook which is really cool I'm.really excited about that so.pinch me of course has a lifetime.warranty so if you break it.they'll replace it so really excited.about that benchmade hook so just a.sneak peek I'll do a complete review,"{'(0.06, 4.079999999999999)': 'hey welcome to

if you pull here you can get some.more pressure there and then the Israeli.bandage has a clip here so you can find.like your last strand that you ran.through and clip it into place to secure,hey welcome to another video from skinny.Matic in this video I want to show you a.couple different pressure bandage trauma.dressings that you may see in my kit you.may see in some other kits on the

4-inch.version the four-inch version is what.you're gonna see in my skinny minute.pocket kit and I did include the.six-inch version in my new kit which is.the skinny medic essentials kit so we.take a

the similarities and not.show you the difference between these.products and the Israeli bandage so as.we roll the product out this is our.bandage here this is where we actually.put the wound on the extremity abdominal.area even a chest area so you can head.pretty much head to toe you can use this.bandage as a bandage so this is where.the wound would go here and then the.unroll and then there's where the wound.would go here so you do note that you.get a larger surface area with a 6-inch.bandage than the 4-inch bandage as I.brought the Israeli bandage here you can.see this is the area or we

it.again so you can generate a lot of.pressure with this 6-inch bandage you.could probably very easily make a.tourniquet out of this by pulling and.getting enough pressure on it you can.generate enough force to control.arterial bleeding we're just using a.pressure bandage now the problem is that.this is difficult to do one-handed if.you're doing on like a upper extremity.so doesn't make a good tourniquet there.but if you're applying someone else.you're applying to a lower extremity you.can make a tourniquet out of a pressure.bandage so then we roll out the Israeli.bandage here kind of the same style.material just got that stretch to it.there again you're pulling generating.pressure and then wrap and secure Nate.all right so we're gonna say that the.injury is here to my upper extremity.this is where the wounds gonna go here.so this is the wound and cut it right.here cut and then wrap it as you come.around if you'll pull more pressure.tight pull around pull and honestly.chilling my legs kind of throbbing.already so has a little bit of velcro.type your fill here.slap it on and it's secured.so the Rayleigh's bandage here same.thing wound on this side now this is.already put our wounds this is a big.difference in here now if you've got.this bracket here that you've got to.come through and then pull back so you.can generate that pressure pull back.pack it wrap it there again as you come.around if you pull here you can get some.more pressure there and then the Israeli.bandage has a clip here so you can find.like your last strand that you ran.through and clip it into place to secure.it so now both benches are secure so.there again you could use this on.extremities as well you can bandage.ahead there again if you've got a head.injury they're gonna bleed pretty loud.so then you can use this bandage here.drop around the head and then wrap it.around like you would any other Gaulle's.chest area as well it's gonna be kind of.hard for you to wrap it by myself you.can wrap it around the chest if you get.it like a flail chest being multiple.broken ribs here you can split that.using a bandage like this just be really.careful not to over compress the chest.sorry because your patient may have a.hard time breathing so if you had some.broken ribs you could use one of these.bandages to bandage those broken ribs.kind of split them in place abdominal.injuries the same thing you could wrap.this around your abdominal injury kind.of support the bleeding keep the.intestines everything like that on the.inside but you could use that just be.very careful not to over compress this.area because you made hurt the breathing.process as well the expansion of the.chest so I hope this video helps you.never know when you'll be the first.responder moving the drive gear and the.right training alright so if you're.stuck in out this long I'm gonna give.you a quick sneak peek up my new kit is.available on the website already have.not done a review video on this yet but.you can see cat tourniquet 6-inch.pressure bandage you get two compressed.galls you get two chest sales it's one.chest sale but there's a twin pack in.there you get an MPA you get an.emergency blanket like a Mylar blanket a.pair of gloves and you can get a bench.mate7 hook which is really cool I'm.really excited about that so.pinch me of course has a lifetime.warranty so if you break it.they'll replace it so really excited.about that benchmade hook so just a.sneak peek I'll do a complete review,"{'(0.06, 4.079999999999999)': 'hey welcome to

VykLxY9mzug,"How to perform the tabletop hand exercise to strengthen the hand after an injury, stroke, cast removal, etc.?","(205, 229)", Yeah All right.Were going to start off.This is called the six pack.I went to I did my schooling at the Mayo clinic.and they used to call it the six pack there.I dont know if they invented it.or its just one that everybody uses. In Rochester Minnesota. Yes Yeah. Lets do the six pack. All right first one is six exercises.So youre going start off with what we call the tabletop.or some call it the duck.Does it look like a duck. Lets just get on with it Bob," Bob and Brad   The two most famous   Physical therapists   On the internet  Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.And we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion, of course, Bob.I forgot to warm up Brad.Oh yeah.Okay, Brad, we're going to talk.about hand and finger exercises,.range of motion and strengthening that you can do.We're going to show you a progression,.show you some exercises you can do at home,.and then we're going to show you a set here.that was actually provided to us by FEI again.FEI.Fabrication Enterprises, Incorporated.This is their catalog If you are a therapist,.I would highly suggest that you grab one and get one.Sure.You can go to their website We'll put that link below.Right.But they gave us all this stuff.We're not getting paid for this.Right.But we don't get paid for anything, do we, Brad?.No, but we do,.we only like to represent quality or products that we like.They're good quality products,.and we feel good about giving a little bump to them.A little plug to them, yeah Mmm hmm.Okay.By the way, they provide some of these products.to retailers too and stuff.Sure.Yeah, these will probably use mostly for therapists.I don't think people are going to buy these.for an individual at home.if they had an accident or rehabbing.But then you at least you'll know what you're looking at.when you go to a therapist and they have these.Yeah, and maybe you'll buy some of these.Yeah Those for sure, actually.Yeah, I could see that.Well, we'll get to that Right.By the way, we're going to introduce.our skeleton again here.Napoleon Not Leopold.Napoleon Bone Apart.Oh yeah, Napoleon.And one of our patients thought it was fun.that she was going to go ahead and decorate it.And she's kind of creative in that regard.And it says I'm with these bone heads.So, I thought it was creative, anyway.Yeah I like what she's got down there.You can't, maybe you can't see that the knee,.she's got the the reflex hammer down there by the kneecap.Yeah And the weight tied into the hand.Yeah So, yeah.Yeah, we'll get him,.we'll get him rehabbed.Yep.All right So let's go ahead and start talking about.your hand after, maybe it was in a cast, you broke it.Sure.Maybe you have arthritis.Maybe you've had a stroke, something.It's weak It's not got the motion it should be.This is where you're going to start.Sure.Now, one of the things that you might try.if you have access to is a Parrafin Bath.This works out really well for someone who's having pain.Look at that, Brad's going to go ahead.We did a whole video on this.We won't take too much time on this right now,.but you just dip it in the Paraffin wax,.and it just envelopes the whole hand.and really provides a good source of heat.Really nice for arthritis.Really good for moisturizing the skin too.It feels great Bob did it last time.And I wanted to make sure I got in on this.[Bob] Brad wanted to get in on it, so.Yeah.[Bob] Alright While Brad's messing around with that,.why don't I go ahead and start off--.Oh, let me get the laundry done here first.Yeah Let's get that out of the way.If you are new to our channel,.I'm going to look over there.like I'm pretending someone just came in.Hi!.Please subscribe to us.We provide videos, how stay healthy, fit, pain free,.and we upload every day.Wow, wow What did you eat this morning?.I'm getting the energy level up here in the house.Holy cow.And also if you have a moment,.wander over to Facebook and like us.Please don't make us beg.We really want you to like us.Right, yeah We feel better.Yeah We feel better about ourselves whenever you do that.I feel better with my hand now This is great.So how are you going to do exercises now?.Well, just wait, Bob Let's start with this one.Yeah All right.We're going to start off.This is called the six pack.I went to, I did my schooling at the Mayo clinic,.and they used to call it the six pack there.I don't know if they invented it,.or it's just one that everybody uses.In Rochester, Minnesota.Yes Yeah.Let's do the six pack.All right, first one is six exercises.So you're going start off with what we call the tabletop.or some call it the duck.Does it look like a duck?.Let's just get on with it, Bob.All right So you go from that,.and then you can go to up to the claw, which is number two.Down, and number two.Now you can do these 10 times.Okay What's next Bob.Okay Now, this is called the P I P joint, right, Brad?.You're just going to bend that one.Ooh.So you know, these,.after an injury or a stroke or something of that nature,.these might be real difficult to do.Right.You may not be able to, you may have to--.You might only get partial way,.and then there's some more advanced things you can do.as far as, you know, holding one joint.and working on trying to get more bend to it.So next one, number four.Now this one you're going to go ahead.and just completely flex everything.and completely extend everything.Completely flex.Completely extend.Okay It's quiet in here today.Yeah, I like it.It's kind of nice.All right, the next one,.you're going to make an O with each finger.Oh, O!.Oh! (chuckles) O.Good.And then sometimes what they have you do.is slide to the bottom of this finger,.and then go back, start again.Oh Yeah.If you've got an itch on your finger,.you could itch it with your thumb like that.So.again, surprisingly Brad,.when you don't use the hand a lot in that certain fashion,.the hand actually gets tired.Yeah I can feel those muscles working.There is no doubt about it.All right, next one--.is the timer, right?.Yeah Oh yeah, it's right.Okay Next one, we're going to go ahead,.and last one, you're going to do.what we call finger abduction.So you're bringing the finger out like this.Now that my hand is warmed up from the wax, Bob,.I'm going to try it with this hand.Oh, look at that.It is amazing.Yeah.Even with a healthy hand, you could feel.how much more movable it is.Look at the erythema on there, by the way.Unfortunately, by the time this video is aired,.we are giving away one of these on Facebook,.which is another reason to like us on Facebook,.we give away a lot of stuff.But by the time this airs,.it's already going to be given away.Sorry Oh, bummer.Yeah All right.So, now that we've got the range of motion,.we're going to start doing some strengthening.And FEI has a whole bunch of strengthening things here,.there are kind of some standards here.This is the Digi-Flex.And this is the whole rack of them that they have.And it goes from the easiest one which is the tan one,.and each one of these little finger,.what would you call that?.(chuckles).See, we're not occupational therapists.They work with this more than,.by far, more than we do.Well, just this little knob here.It's like a trumpet.Well, it's for your finger.Yeah Yeah.For your finger flexors.So anyway, by pushing just the one finger,.that's just 075 pounds of pressure.Sure.If you do the whole hand, it's 25.Now moving up to like the red,.that's three pounds per finger.or 10 pounds per the hand.And if you go all the way to the most difficult one,.try even the gray one, Brad.These are very difficult.This is 13 pounds per finger, and I can't even--.Ooh Yeah, right.You know, I can't even hardly push that down.Right.And especially when you get down to the pinky.Yeah Yeah Oh my God That just--.But when you do all of them together,.it's amazing how much more, you know,.strength you can get with the cumulative--.Yeah, it pushes me to the limit though.You know, that's 43 pounds.Sure Right And so.It's got a nice contour here for the palm.So this is a set that,.it just works out really well for progression.He always puts them in upside down.Oh, did I put them in upside down?.Yeah Brad's,.Brad's more ofthat way.Yeah (chuckles).If you know what I mean?.All right, this is a Digi-Extend,.and this is just a real simple device.And what provides the resistance on here is rubber bands.I want to show some,.a lot of the different rubber bands, Brad.So, this is one of the easiest ones.And you can see, I can get all the fingers.and we're working on extending,.working on extending the fingers.And, you know, you can get more resistance.by using a heavier band.The darker the color typically,.and that's way it is on this product,.the darker the color, the more resistance.And you simply,.it takes a little time to change the rubber band out.So we're not gonna take the time to do that.And not that you have to necessarily change it.You could put two in it at the same time.Oh Sure, and double up the resistance.Yep, and the thing about that is,.yeah, now it's going to be really tough.Here, I just got it on Two of them, or one of them there.And that one is really working now.Right So.Yeah.So you can get plenty of resistance.Right.I don't care how tough you are.So the product that I really like Brad, is this Digi-Flex,.it's called, Multi-Progressive Exercise System.Yeah.This is really cool, and the reason it's really cool--.Now, again, we start with the yellow, which is only 15,.but you can interchange these.So if you're finding one of the fingers is a little bit weak.you can actually put in a heavier dose in there.So they just change easy, too.You just pull them out.I'm going to grab one of your black ones there.and slide it in, and you know, you're off and running.This is a beautiful set Right.I really love this.This is, you know, the interchangeable inserts here.And of course, again,.they're color coded by the resistance levels.And you can keep them arranged in here.So, you know,.this is something that at the professional level, you know,.occupational therapists or physical therapists.could really take advantage of for hand rehab.[Bob] To be honest, Brad, I already have,.my occupational therapist team has already been saying,.""Hey, can we get at this?"".And they have a patient they want to use it.Yeah, they want it.So I said, ""No, we have to do the video today"".And now after that, they're going to go ahead and grab it.So, all right.So, very cool.That's the, again, CanDo.This is the brand name of this, Brad, by the way.I like that Can-Do it.Yeah CanDo.Yeah Very positive.Digi-Flex Multi-Hand Exerciser.I wanted to make sure I got the name right.So, it's like a trumpet.That's what I was thinking.If you're a trumpet player and you're rehabbing,.this would be ideal (Bob laughing).It would.All right, the last one here,.you've got a little display tray here.Whoops Look at that Oh Bob.Why, Bob, why?.I didn't stick them in there hard enough.All right, this is the,.I want to, again, make sure I get it right,.the Digi-Extend and Squeeze.[Brad] Oh.[Bob] So what's nice about this.is that you're going to be able to work on flexion.and extension at the same time.Or, you know, you can work one then the other.But this is something you may want to buy.as a patient, even.[Brad] Yeah This is something I could see.Because you know,.what it has is, it's got five different firmnesses.That's what these five are.I want to push this in here to make sure.it's not going to do that same thing again.[Brad] So the darkest ball is much firmer foam rubber.Much firmer.And the lighter color yellow is much easier.Yeah, this one's a lot easier.So you'd start with the yellow.And as your hand gets stronger, progress up to the black.They also have three sizes,.and I don't know which size this is?.I don't know if this is the medium,.but they have small, medium, large.So you can figure out which one would work out.Right Depending on what size hand you have, of course.But let me just show you a few.of the exercises you can do with this.One, you can, of course, just do full flexion.You can work on just flexing the end, so the fingertips.Right Like this.So you get that pincher grip versus the full grip.And that's another one you can do, Brad,.is you can just do pincer like this.Sure Yep.You put the two fingers together.You can work pincer on each finger.Yep.You can actually work on just extension, of course.And then you can even hook in here.and work on flexion like this, you know, individually.So if you want to just work on flexion like this.Sure Yep.If you wanted to break it down that detailed.So there's a lot of different things you can do with that.So really cool set.Again, you can look at the website below.You know, right now, I'm afraid we've got to stop.and let our occupational therapists have their hand at it.(Brad chuckles).And remember, Brad and I can fix just about anything.Except for that broken heart.I don't know if this is going to help with that.But we are working on it Yeah, it might, you know.There you go.Okay Thanks","{'(0.36, 2.216)': '

below.Right.But they gave us all this stuff.We're not getting paid for this.Right.But we don't get paid for anything, do we, Brad?.No, but we do,.we only like to represent quality or products that we like.They're good quality products,.and we feel good about giving a little bump to them.A little plug to them, yeah Mmm hmm.Okay.By the way, they provide some of these products.to retailers too and stuff.Sure.Yeah, these will probably use mostly for therapists.I don't think people are going to buy these.for an individual at home.if they had an accident or rehabbing.But then you at least you'll know what you're looking at.when you go to a therapist and they have these.Yeah, and maybe you'll buy some of these.Yeah Those for sure, actually.Yeah, I could see that.Well, we'll get to that Right.By the way, we're going to introduce.our skeleton again here.Napoleon Not Leopold.Napoleon Bone Apart.Oh yeah, Napoleon.And one of our patients thought it was fun.that she was going to go ahead and decorate it.And she's kind of creative in that regard.And it says I'm with these bone heads.So, I thought it was creative, anyway.Yeah I like what she's got down there.You can't, maybe you can't see that the knee,.she's got the the reflex hammer down there by the kneecap.Yeah And the weight tied into the hand.Yeah So, yeah.Yeah, we'll get him,.we'll get him rehabbed.Yep.All right So let's go ahead and start talking about.your hand after, maybe it was in a cast, you broke it.Sure.Maybe you have arthritis.Maybe you've had a stroke, something.It's weak It's not got the motion it should be.This is where you're going to start.Sure.Now, one of the things that you might try.if you have access to is a Parrafin Bath.This works out really well for someone who's having pain.Look at that, Brad's going to go ahead.We did a whole video on this.We won't take too much time on this right now,.but you just dip it in the Paraffin wax,.and it just envelopes the whole hand.and really provides a good source of heat.Really nice for arthritis.Really good for moisturizing the skin too.It feels great Bob did it last time.And I wanted to make sure I got in on this.[Bob] Brad wanted to get in on it, so.Yeah.[Bob] Alright While Brad's messing around with that,.why don't I go ahead and start off--.Oh, let me get the laundry done here first.Yeah Let's get that out of the way.If you are new to our channel,.I'm going to look over there.like I'm pretending someone just came in.Hi!.Please subscribe to us.We provide videos, how stay healthy, fit, pain free,.and we upload every day.Wow, wow What did you eat this morning?.I'm getting the energy level up here in the house.Holy cow.And also if you have a moment,.wander over to Facebook and like us.Please don't make us beg.We really want you to like us.Right, yeah We feel better.Yeah We feel better about ourselves whenever you do that.I feel better with my hand now This is great.So how are you going to do exercises now?.Well, just wait, Bob Let's start with this one.Yeah All right.We're going to start off.This is called the six pack.I went to, I did my schooling at the Mayo clinic,.and they used to call it the six pack there.I don't know if they invented it,.or it's just one that everybody uses.In Rochester, Minnesota.Yes Yeah.Let's do the six pack.All right, first one is six exercises.So you're going start off with what we call the tabletop.or some call it the duck.Does it look like a duck?.Let's just get on with it, Bob.All right So you go from that,.and then you can go to up to the claw, which is number two.Down, and number two.Now you can do these 10 times.Okay What's next Bob.Okay Now, this is called the P I P joint, right, Brad?.You're just going to bend that one.Ooh.So you know, these,.after an injury or a stroke or something of that nature,.these might be real difficult to do.Right.You may not be able to, you may have to--.You might only get partial way,.and then there's some more advanced things you can do.as far as, you know, holding one joint.and working on trying to get more bend to it.So next one, number four.Now this one you're going to go ahead.and just completely flex everything.and completely extend everything.Completely flex.Completely extend.Okay It's quiet in here today.Yeah, I like it.It's kind of nice.All right, the next one,.you're going to make an O with each finger.Oh, O!.Oh! (chuckles) O.Good.And then sometimes what they have you do.is slide to the bottom of this finger,.and then go back, start again.Oh Yeah.If you've got an itch on your finger,.you could itch it with your thumb like that.So.again, surprisingly Brad,.when you don't use the hand a lot in that certain fashion,.the hand actually gets tired.Yeah I can feel those muscles working.There is no doubt about it.All right, next one--.is the timer, right?.Yeah Oh yeah, it's right.Okay Next one, we're going to go ahead,.and last one, you're going to do.what we call finger abduction.So you're bringing the finger out like this.Now that my hand is warmed up from the wax, Bob,.I'm going to try it with this hand.Oh, look at that.It is amazing.Yeah.Even with a healthy hand, you could feel.how much more movable it is.Look at the erythema on there, by the way.Unfortunately, by the time this video is aired,.we are giving away one of these on Facebook,.which is another reason to like us on Facebook,.we give away a lot of stuff.But by the time this airs,.it's already going to be given away.Sorry Oh, bummer.Yeah All right.So, now that we've got the range of motion,.we're going to start doing some strengthening.And FEI has a whole bunch of strengthening things here,.there are kind of some standards here.This is the Digi-Flex.And this is the whole rack of them that they have.And it goes from the easiest one which is the tan one,.and each one of these little finger,.what would you call that?.(chuckles).See, we're not occupational therapists.They work with this more than,.by far, more than we do.Well, just this little knob here.It's like a trumpet.Well, it's for your finger.Yeah Yeah.For your finger flexors.So anyway, by pushing just the one finger,.that's just 075 pounds of pressure.Sure.If you do the whole hand, it's 25.Now moving up to like the red,.that's three pounds per finger.or 10 pounds per the hand.And if you go all the way to the most difficult one,.try even the gray one, Brad.These are very difficult.This is 13 pounds per finger, and I can't even--.Ooh Yeah, right.You know, I can't even hardly push that down.Right.And especially when you get down to the pinky.Yeah Yeah Oh my God That just--.But when you do all of them together,.it's amazing how much more, you know,.strength you can get with the cumulative--.Yeah, it pushes me to the limit though.You know, that's 43 pounds.Sure Right And so.It's got a nice contour here for the palm.So this is a set that,.it just works out really well for progression.He always puts them in upside down.Oh, did I put them in upside down?.Yeah Brad's,.Brad's more ofthat way.Yeah (chuckles).If you know what I mean?.All right, this is a Digi-Extend,.and this is just a real simple device.And what provides the resistance on here is rubber bands.I want to show some,.a lot of the different rubber bands, Brad.So, this is one of the easiest ones.And you can see, I can get all the fingers.and we're working on extending,.working on extending the fingers.And, you know, you can get more resistance.by using a heavier band.The darker the color typically,.and that's way it is on this product,.the darker the color, the more resistance.And you simply,.it takes a little time to change the rubber band out.So we're not gonna take the time to do that.And not that you have to necessarily change it.You could put two in it at the same time.Oh Sure, and double up the resistance.Yep, and the thing about that is,.yeah, now it's going to be really tough.Here, I just got it on Two of them, or one of them there.And that one is really working now.Right So.Yeah.So you can get plenty of resistance.Right.I don't care how tough you are.So the product that I really like Brad, is this Digi-Flex,.it's called, Multi-Progressive Exercise System.Yeah.This is really cool, and the reason it's really cool--.Now, again, we start with the yellow, which is only 15,.but you can interchange these.So if you're finding one of the fingers is a little bit weak.you can actually put in a heavier dose in there.So they just change easy, too.You just pull them out.I'm going to grab one of your black ones there.and slide it in, and you know, you're off and running.This is a beautiful set Right.I really love this.This is, you know, the interchangeable inserts here.And of course, again,.they're color coded by the resistance levels.And you can keep them arranged in here.So, you know,.this is something that at the professional level, you know,.occupational therapists or physical therapists.could really take advantage of for hand rehab.[Bob] To be honest, Brad, I already have,.my occupational therapist team has already been saying,.""Hey, can we get at this?"".And they have a patient they want to use it.Yeah, they want it.So I said, ""No, we have to do the video today"".And now after that, they're going to go ahead and grab it.So, all right.So, very cool.That's the, again, CanDo.This is the brand name of this, Brad, by the way.I like that Can-Do it.Yeah CanDo.Yeah Very positive.Digi-Flex Multi-Hand Exerciser.I wanted to make sure I got the name right.So, it's like a trumpet.That's what I was thinking.If you're a trumpet player and you're rehabbing,.this would be ideal (Bob laughing).It would.All right, the last one here,.you've got a little display tray here.Whoops Look at that Oh Bob.Why, Bob, why?.I didn't stick them in there hard enough.All right, this is the,.I want to, again, make sure I get it right,.the Digi-Extend and Squeeze.[Brad] Oh.[Bob] So what's nice about this.is that you're going to be able to work on flexion.and extension at the same time.Or, you know, you can work one then the other.But this is something you may want to buy.as a patient, even.[Brad] Yeah This is something I could see.Because you know,.what it has is, it's got five different firmnesses.That's what these five are.I want to push this in here to make sure.it's not going to do that same thing again.[Brad] So the darkest ball is much firmer foam rubber.Much firmer.And the lighter color yellow is much easier.Yeah, this one's a lot easier.So you'd start with the yellow.And as your hand gets stronger, progress up to the black.They also have three sizes,.and I don't know which size this is?.I don't know if this is the medium,.but they have small, medium, large.So you can figure out which one would work out.Right Depending on what size hand you have, of course.But let me just show you a few.of the exercises you can do with this.One, you can, of course, just do full flexion.You can work on just flexing the end, so the fingertips.Right Like this.So you get that pincher grip versus the full grip.And that's another one you can do, Brad,.is you can just do pincer like this.Sure Yep.You put the two fingers together.You can work pincer on each finger.Yep.You can actually work on just extension, of course.And then you can even hook in here.and work on flexion like this, you know, individually.So if you want to just work on flexion like this.Sure Yep.If you wanted to break it down that detailed.So there's a lot of different things you can do with that.So really cool set.Again, you can look at the website below.You know, right now, I'm afraid we've got to stop.and let our occupational therapists have their hand at it.(Brad chuckles).And remember, Brad and I can fix just about anything.Except for that broken heart.I don't know if this is going to help with that.But we are working on it Yeah, it might, you know.There you go.Okay Thanks","{'(0.36, 2.216)': '

VykLxY9mzug,"How to bend the fingers at the knuckles to strengthen the fingers after an injury, stroke, cast removal, etc.?","(241, 265)", Okay Whats next Bob. Okay Now this is called the P I P joint right Brad.Youre just going to bend that one. Ooh.So you know these.after an injury or a stroke or something of that nature.these might be real difficult to do. Right. You may not be able to you may have to. You might only get partial way.and then theres some more advanced things you can do.as far as you know holding one joint.and working on trying to get more bend to it," Bob and Brad   The two most famous   Physical therapists   On the internet  Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.And we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion, of course, Bob.I forgot to warm up Brad.Oh yeah.Okay, Brad, we're going to talk.about hand and finger exercises,.range of motion and strengthening that you can do.We're going to show you a progression,.show you some exercises you can do at home,.and then we're going to show you a set here.that was actually provided to us by FEI again.FEI.Fabrication Enterprises, Incorporated.This is their catalog If you are a therapist,.I would highly suggest that you grab one and get one.Sure.You can go to their website We'll put that link below.Right.But they gave us all this stuff.We're not getting paid for this.Right.But we don't get paid for anything, do we, Brad?.No, but we do,.we only like to represent quality or products that we like.They're good quality products,.and we feel good about giving a little bump to them.A little plug to them, yeah Mmm hmm.Okay.By the way, they provide some of these products.to retailers too and stuff.Sure.Yeah, these will probably use mostly for therapists.I don't think people are going to buy these.for an individual at home.if they had an accident or rehabbing.But then you at least you'll know what you're looking at.when you go to a therapist and they have these.Yeah, and maybe you'll buy some of these.Yeah Those for sure, actually.Yeah, I could see that.Well, we'll get to that Right.By the way, we're going to introduce.our skeleton again here.Napoleon Not Leopold.Napoleon Bone Apart.Oh yeah, Napoleon.And one of our patients thought it was fun.that she was going to go ahead and decorate it.And she's kind of creative in that regard.And it says I'm with these bone heads.So, I thought it was creative, anyway.Yeah I like what she's got down there.You can't, maybe you can't see that the knee,.she's got the the reflex hammer down there by the kneecap.Yeah And the weight tied into the hand.Yeah So, yeah.Yeah, we'll get him,.we'll get him rehabbed.Yep.All right So let's go ahead and start talking about.your hand after, maybe it was in a cast, you broke it.Sure.Maybe you have arthritis.Maybe you've had a stroke, something.It's weak It's not got the motion it should be.This is where you're going to start.Sure.Now, one of the things that you might try.if you have access to is a Parrafin Bath.This works out really well for someone who's having pain.Look at that, Brad's going to go ahead.We did a whole video on this.We won't take too much time on this right now,.but you just dip it in the Paraffin wax,.and it just envelopes the whole hand.and really provides a good source of heat.Really nice for arthritis.Really good for moisturizing the skin too.It feels great Bob did it last time.And I wanted to make sure I got in on this.[Bob] Brad wanted to get in on it, so.Yeah.[Bob] Alright While Brad's messing around with that,.why don't I go ahead and start off--.Oh, let me get the laundry done here first.Yeah Let's get that out of the way.If you are new to our channel,.I'm going to look over there.like I'm pretending someone just came in.Hi!.Please subscribe to us.We provide videos, how stay healthy, fit, pain free,.and we upload every day.Wow, wow What did you eat this morning?.I'm getting the energy level up here in the house.Holy cow.And also if you have a moment,.wander over to Facebook and like us.Please don't make us beg.We really want you to like us.Right, yeah We feel better.Yeah We feel better about ourselves whenever you do that.I feel better with my hand now This is great.So how are you going to do exercises now?.Well, just wait, Bob Let's start with this one.Yeah All right.We're going to start off.This is called the six pack.I went to, I did my schooling at the Mayo clinic,.and they used to call it the six pack there.I don't know if they invented it,.or it's just one that everybody uses.In Rochester, Minnesota.Yes Yeah.Let's do the six pack.All right, first one is six exercises.So you're going start off with what we call the tabletop.or some call it the duck.Does it look like a duck?.Let's just get on with it, Bob.All right So you go from that,.and then you can go to up to the claw, which is number two.Down, and number two.Now you can do these 10 times.Okay What's next Bob.Okay Now, this is called the P I P joint, right, Brad?.You're just going to bend that one.Ooh.So you know, these,.after an injury or a stroke or something of that nature,.these might be real difficult to do.Right.You may not be able to, you may have to--.You might only get partial way,.and then there's some more advanced things you can do.as far as, you know, holding one joint.and working on trying to get more bend to it.So next one, number four.Now this one you're going to go ahead.and just completely flex everything.and completely extend everything.Completely flex.Completely extend.Okay It's quiet in here today.Yeah, I like it.It's kind of nice.All right, the next one,.you're going to make an O with each finger.Oh, O!.Oh! (chuckles) O.Good.And then sometimes what they have you do.is slide to the bottom of this finger,.and then go back, start again.Oh Yeah.If you've got an itch on your finger,.you could itch it with your thumb like that.So.again, surprisingly Brad,.when you don't use the hand a lot in that certain fashion,.the hand actually gets tired.Yeah I can feel those muscles working.There is no doubt about it.All right, next one--.is the timer, right?.Yeah Oh yeah, it's right.Okay Next one, we're going to go ahead,.and last one, you're going to do.what we call finger abduction.So you're bringing the finger out like this.Now that my hand is warmed up from the wax, Bob,.I'm going to try it with this hand.Oh, look at that.It is amazing.Yeah.Even with a healthy hand, you could feel.how much more movable it is.Look at the erythema on there, by the way.Unfortunately, by the time this video is aired,.we are giving away one of these on Facebook,.which is another reason to like us on Facebook,.we give away a lot of stuff.But by the time this airs,.it's already going to be given away.Sorry Oh, bummer.Yeah All right.So, now that we've got the range of motion,.we're going to start doing some strengthening.And FEI has a whole bunch of strengthening things here,.there are kind of some standards here.This is the Digi-Flex.And this is the whole rack of them that they have.And it goes from the easiest one which is the tan one,.and each one of these little finger,.what would you call that?.(chuckles).See, we're not occupational therapists.They work with this more than,.by far, more than we do.Well, just this little knob here.It's like a trumpet.Well, it's for your finger.Yeah Yeah.For your finger flexors.So anyway, by pushing just the one finger,.that's just 075 pounds of pressure.Sure.If you do the whole hand, it's 25.Now moving up to like the red,.that's three pounds per finger.or 10 pounds per the hand.And if you go all the way to the most difficult one,.try even the gray one, Brad.These are very difficult.This is 13 pounds per finger, and I can't even--.Ooh Yeah, right.You know, I can't even hardly push that down.Right.And especially when you get down to the pinky.Yeah Yeah Oh my God That just--.But when you do all of them together,.it's amazing how much more, you know,.strength you can get with the cumulative--.Yeah, it pushes me to the limit though.You know, that's 43 pounds.Sure Right And so.It's got a nice contour here for the palm.So this is a set that,.it just works out really well for progression.He always puts them in upside down.Oh, did I put them in upside down?.Yeah Brad's,.Brad's more ofthat way.Yeah (chuckles).If you know what I mean?.All right, this is a Digi-Extend,.and this is just a real simple device.And what provides the resistance on here is rubber bands.I want to show some,.a lot of the different rubber bands, Brad.So, this is one of the easiest ones.And you can see, I can get all the fingers.and we're working on extending,.working on extending the fingers.And, you know, you can get more resistance.by using a heavier band.The darker the color typically,.and that's way it is on this product,.the darker the color, the more resistance.And you simply,.it takes a little time to change the rubber band out.So we're not gonna take the time to do that.And not that you have to necessarily change it.You could put two in it at the same time.Oh Sure, and double up the resistance.Yep, and the thing about that is,.yeah, now it's going to be really tough.Here, I just got it on Two of them, or one of them there.And that one is really working now.Right So.Yeah.So you can get plenty of resistance.Right.I don't care how tough you are.So the product that I really like Brad, is this Digi-Flex,.it's called, Multi-Progressive Exercise System.Yeah.This is really cool, and the reason it's really cool--.Now, again, we start with the yellow, which is only 15,.but you can interchange these.So if you're finding one of the fingers is a little bit weak.you can actually put in a heavier dose in there.So they just change easy, too.You just pull them out.I'm going to grab one of your black ones there.and slide it in, and you know, you're off and running.This is a beautiful set Right.I really love this.This is, you know, the interchangeable inserts here.And of course, again,.they're color coded by the resistance levels.And you can keep them arranged in here.So, you know,.this is something that at the professional level, you know,.occupational therapists or physical therapists.could really take advantage of for hand rehab.[Bob] To be honest, Brad, I already have,.my occupational therapist team has already been saying,.""Hey, can we get at this?"".And they have a patient they want to use it.Yeah, they want it.So I said, ""No, we have to do the video today"".And now after that, they're going to go ahead and grab it.So, all right.So, very cool.That's the, again, CanDo.This is the brand name of this, Brad, by the way.I like that Can-Do it.Yeah CanDo.Yeah Very positive.Digi-Flex Multi-Hand Exerciser.I wanted to make sure I got the name right.So, it's like a trumpet.That's what I was thinking.If you're a trumpet player and you're rehabbing,.this would be ideal (Bob laughing).It would.All right, the last one here,.you've got a little display tray here.Whoops Look at that Oh Bob.Why, Bob, why?.I didn't stick them in there hard enough.All right, this is the,.I want to, again, make sure I get it right,.the Digi-Extend and Squeeze.[Brad] Oh.[Bob] So what's nice about this.is that you're going to be able to work on flexion.and extension at the same time.Or, you know, you can work one then the other.But this is something you may want to buy.as a patient, even.[Brad] Yeah This is something I could see.Because you know,.what it has is, it's got five different firmnesses.That's what these five are.I want to push this in here to make sure.it's not going to do that same thing again.[Brad] So the darkest ball is much firmer foam rubber.Much firmer.And the lighter color yellow is much easier.Yeah, this one's a lot easier.So you'd start with the yellow.And as your hand gets stronger, progress up to the black.They also have three sizes,.and I don't know which size this is?.I don't know if this is the medium,.but they have small, medium, large.So you can figure out which one would work out.Right Depending on what size hand you have, of course.But let me just show you a few.of the exercises you can do with this.One, you can, of course, just do full flexion.You can work on just flexing the end, so the fingertips.Right Like this.So you get that pincher grip versus the full grip.And that's another one you can do, Brad,.is you can just do pincer like this.Sure Yep.You put the two fingers together.You can work pincer on each finger.Yep.You can actually work on just extension, of course.And then you can even hook in here.and work on flexion like this, you know, individually.So if you want to just work on flexion like this.Sure Yep.If you wanted to break it down that detailed.So there's a lot of different things you can do with that.So really cool set.Again, you can look at the website below.You know, right now, I'm afraid we've got to stop.and let our occupational therapists have their hand at it.(Brad chuckles).And remember, Brad and I can fix just about anything.Except for that broken heart.I don't know if this is going to help with that.But we are working on it Yeah, it might, you know.There you go.Okay Thanks","{'(0.36, 2.216)': '

VykLxY9mzug,"How to bend all the fingers to strengthen the fingers after an injury, stroke, cast removal, etc.?","(266, 284)",and working on trying to get more bend to it.So next one number four.Now this one youre going to go ahead.and just completely flex everything.and completely extend everything.Completely flex.Completely extend.Okay Its quiet in here today. Yeah I like it. Its kind of nice," Bob and Brad   The two most famous   Physical therapists   On the internet  Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.And we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion, of course, Bob.I forgot to warm up Brad.Oh yeah.Okay, Brad, we're going to talk.about hand and finger exercises,.range of motion and strengthening that you can do.We're going to show you a progression,.show you some exercises you can do at home,.and then we're going to show you a set here.that was actually provided to us by FEI again.FEI.Fabrication Enterprises, Incorporated.This is their catalog If you are a therapist,.I would highly suggest that you grab one and get one.Sure.You can go to their website We'll put that link below.Right.But they gave us all this stuff.We're not getting paid for this.Right.But we don't get paid for anything, do we, Brad?.No, but we do,.we only like to represent quality or products that we like.They're good quality products,.and we feel good about giving a little bump to them.A little plug to them, yeah Mmm hmm.Okay.By the way, they provide some of these products.to retailers too and stuff.Sure.Yeah, these will probably use mostly for therapists.I don't think people are going to buy these.for an individual at home.if they had an accident or rehabbing.But then you at least you'll know what you're looking at.when you go to a therapist and they have these.Yeah, and maybe you'll buy some of these.Yeah Those for sure, actually.Yeah, I could see that.Well, we'll get to that Right.By the way, we're going to introduce.our skeleton again here.Napoleon Not Leopold.Napoleon Bone Apart.Oh yeah, Napoleon.And one of our patients thought it was fun.that she was going to go ahead and decorate it.And she's kind of creative in that regard.And it says I'm with these bone heads.So, I thought it was creative, anyway.Yeah I like what she's got down there.You can't, maybe you can't see that the knee,.she's got the the reflex hammer down there by the kneecap.Yeah And the weight tied into the hand.Yeah So, yeah.Yeah, we'll get him,.we'll get him rehabbed.Yep.All right So let's go ahead and start talking about.your hand after, maybe it was in a cast, you broke it.Sure.Maybe you have arthritis.Maybe you've had a stroke, something.It's weak It's not got the motion it should be.This is where you're going to start.Sure.Now, one of the things that you might try.if you have access to is a Parrafin Bath.This works out really well for someone who's having pain.Look at that, Brad's going to go ahead.We did a whole video on this.We won't take too much time on this right now,.but you just dip it in the Paraffin wax,.and it just envelopes the whole hand.and really provides a good source of heat.Really nice for arthritis.Really good for moisturizing the skin too.It feels great Bob did it last time.And I wanted to make sure I got in on this.[Bob] Brad wanted to get in on it, so.Yeah.[Bob] Alright While Brad's messing around with that,.why don't I go ahead and start off--.Oh, let me get the laundry done here first.Yeah Let's get that out of the way.If you are new to our channel,.I'm going to look over there.like I'm pretending someone just came in.Hi!.Please subscribe to us.We provide videos, how stay healthy, fit, pain free,.and we upload every day.Wow, wow What did you eat this morning?.I'm getting the energy level up here in the house.Holy cow.And also if you have a moment,.wander over to Facebook and like us.Please don't make us beg.We really want you to like us.Right, yeah We feel better.Yeah We feel better about ourselves whenever you do that.I feel better with my hand now This is great.So how are you going to do exercises now?.Well, just wait, Bob Let's start with this one.Yeah All right.We're going to start off.This is called the six pack.I went to, I did my schooling at the Mayo clinic,.and they used to call it the six pack there.I don't know if they invented it,.or it's just one that everybody uses.In Rochester, Minnesota.Yes Yeah.Let's do the six pack.All right, first one is six exercises.So you're going start off with what we call the tabletop.or some call it the duck.Does it look like a duck?.Let's just get on with it, Bob.All right So you go from that,.and then you can go to up to the claw, which is number two.Down, and number two.Now you can do these 10 times.Okay What's next Bob.Okay Now, this is called the P I P joint, right, Brad?.You're just going to bend that one.Ooh.So you know, these,.after an injury or a stroke or something of that nature,.these might be real difficult to do.Right.You may not be able to, you may have to--.You might only get partial way,.and then there's some more advanced things you can do.as far as, you know, holding one joint.and working on trying to get more bend to it.So next one, number four.Now this one you're going to go ahead.and just completely flex everything.and completely extend everything.Completely flex.Completely extend.Okay It's quiet in here today.Yeah, I like it.It's kind of nice.All right, the next one,.you're going to make an O with each finger.Oh, O!.Oh! (chuckles) O.Good.And then sometimes what they have you do.is slide to the bottom of this finger,.and then go back, start again.Oh Yeah.If you've got an itch on your finger,.you could itch it with your thumb like that.So.again, surprisingly Brad,.when you don't use the hand a lot in that certain fashion,.the hand actually gets tired.Yeah I can feel those muscles working.There is no doubt about it.All right, next one--.is the timer, right?.Yeah Oh yeah, it's right.Okay Next one, we're going to go ahead,.and last one, you're going to do.what we call finger abduction.So you're bringing the finger out like this.Now that my hand is warmed up from the wax, Bob,.I'm going to try it with this hand.Oh, look at that.It is amazing.Yeah.Even with a healthy hand, you could feel.how much more movable it is.Look at the erythema on there, by the way.Unfortunately, by the time this video is aired,.we are giving away one of these on Facebook,.which is another reason to like us on Facebook,.we give away a lot of stuff.But by the time this airs,.it's already going to be given away.Sorry Oh, bummer.Yeah All right.So, now that we've got the range of motion,.we're going to start doing some strengthening.And FEI has a whole bunch of strengthening things here,.there are kind of some standards here.This is the Digi-Flex.And this is the whole rack of them that they have.And it goes from the easiest one which is the tan one,.and each one of these little finger,.what would you call that?.(chuckles).See, we're not occupational therapists.They work with this more than,.by far, more than we do.Well, just this little knob here.It's like a trumpet.Well, it's for your finger.Yeah Yeah.For your finger flexors.So anyway, by pushing just the one finger,.that's just 075 pounds of pressure.Sure.If you do the whole hand, it's 25.Now moving up to like the red,.that's three pounds per finger.or 10 pounds per the hand.And if you go all the way to the most difficult one,.try even the gray one, Brad.These are very difficult.This is 13 pounds per finger, and I can't even--.Ooh Yeah, right.You know, I can't even hardly push that down.Right.And especially when you get down to the pinky.Yeah Yeah Oh my God That just--.But when you do all of them together,.it's amazing how much more, you know,.strength you can get with the cumulative--.Yeah, it pushes me to the limit though.You know, that's 43 pounds.Sure Right And so.It's got a nice contour here for the palm.So this is a set that,.it just works out really well for progression.He always puts them in upside down.Oh, did I put them in upside down?.Yeah Brad's,.Brad's more ofthat way.Yeah (chuckles).If you know what I mean?.All right, this is a Digi-Extend,.and this is just a real simple device.And what provides the resistance on here is rubber bands.I want to show some,.a lot of the different rubber bands, Brad.So, this is one of the easiest ones.And you can see, I can get all the fingers.and we're working on extending,.working on extending the fingers.And, you know, you can get more resistance.by using a heavier band.The darker the color typically,.and that's way it is on this product,.the darker the color, the more resistance.And you simply,.it takes a little time to change the rubber band out.So we're not gonna take the time to do that.And not that you have to necessarily change it.You could put two in it at the same time.Oh Sure, and double up the resistance.Yep, and the thing about that is,.yeah, now it's going to be really tough.Here, I just got it on Two of them, or one of them there.And that one is really working now.Right So.Yeah.So you can get plenty of resistance.Right.I don't care how tough you are.So the product that I really like Brad, is this Digi-Flex,.it's called, Multi-Progressive Exercise System.Yeah.This is really cool, and the reason it's really cool--.Now, again, we start with the yellow, which is only 15,.but you can interchange these.So if you're finding one of the fingers is a little bit weak.you can actually put in a heavier dose in there.So they just change easy, too.You just pull them out.I'm going to grab one of your black ones there.and slide it in, and you know, you're off and running.This is a beautiful set Right.I really love this.This is, you know, the interchangeable inserts here.And of course, again,.they're color coded by the resistance levels.And you can keep them arranged in here.So, you know,.this is something that at the professional level, you know,.occupational therapists or physical therapists.could really take advantage of for hand rehab.[Bob] To be honest, Brad, I already have,.my occupational therapist team has already been saying,.""Hey, can we get at this?"".And they have a patient they want to use it.Yeah, they want it.So I said, ""No, we have to do the video today"".And now after that, they're going to go ahead and grab it.So, all right.So, very cool.That's the, again, CanDo.This is the brand name of this, Brad, by the way.I like that Can-Do it.Yeah CanDo.Yeah Very positive.Digi-Flex Multi-Hand Exerciser.I wanted to make sure I got the name right.So, it's like a trumpet.That's what I was thinking.If you're a trumpet player and you're rehabbing,.this would be ideal (Bob laughing).It would.All right, the last one here,.you've got a little display tray here.Whoops Look at that Oh Bob.Why, Bob, why?.I didn't stick them in there hard enough.All right, this is the,.I want to, again, make sure I get it right,.the Digi-Extend and Squeeze.[Brad] Oh.[Bob] So what's nice about this.is that you're going to be able to work on flexion.and extension at the same time.Or, you know, you can work one then the other.But this is something you may want to buy.as a patient, even.[Brad] Yeah This is something I could see.Because you know,.what it has is, it's got five different firmnesses.That's what these five are.I want to push this in here to make sure.it's not going to do that same thing again.[Brad] So the darkest ball is much firmer foam rubber.Much firmer.And the lighter color yellow is much easier.Yeah, this one's a lot easier.So you'd start with the yellow.And as your hand gets stronger, progress up to the black.They also have three sizes,.and I don't know which size this is?.I don't know if this is the medium,.but they have small, medium, large.So you can figure out which one would work out.Right Depending on what size hand you have, of course.But let me just show you a few.of the exercises you can do with this.One, you can, of course, just do full flexion.You can work on just flexing the end, so the fingertips.Right Like this.So you get that pincher grip versus the full grip.And that's another one you can do, Brad,.is you can just do pincer like this.Sure Yep.You put the two fingers together.You can work pincer on each finger.Yep.You can actually work on just extension, of course.And then you can even hook in here.and work on flexion like this, you know, individually.So if you want to just work on flexion like this.Sure Yep.If you wanted to break it down that detailed.So there's a lot of different things you can do with that.So really cool set.Again, you can look at the website below.You know, right now, I'm afraid we've got to stop.and let our occupational therapists have their hand at it.(Brad chuckles).And remember, Brad and I can

Oh O. Oh chuckles  O.Good.And then sometimes what they have you do.is slide to the bottom of this finger.and then go back start again. Oh  Yeah. If youve got an itch on your finger.you could itch it with your thumb like that. So.again surprisingly Brad.when you dont use the hand a lot in that certain fashion.the hand actually gets tired. Yeah I can feel those muscles working.There is no doubt about it," Bob and Brad   The two most famous   Physical therapists   On the internet  Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.And we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion, of course, Bob.I forgot to warm up Brad.Oh yeah.Okay, Brad, we're going to talk.about hand and finger exercises,.range of motion and strengthening that you can do.We're going to show you a progression,.show you some exercises you can do at home,.and then we're going to show you a set here.that was actually provided to us by FEI again.FEI.Fabrication Enterprises, Incorporated.This is their catalog If you are a therapist,.I would highly suggest that you grab one and get one.Sure.You can go to their website We'll put that link below.Right.But they gave us all this stuff.We're not getting paid for this.Right.But we don't get paid for anything, do we, Brad?.No, but we do,.we only like to represent quality or products that we like.They're good quality products,.and we feel good about giving a little bump to them.A little plug to them, yeah Mmm hmm.Okay.By the way, they provide some of these products.to retailers too and stuff.Sure.Yeah, these will probably use mostly for therapists.I don't think people are going to buy these.for an individual at home.if they had an accident or rehabbing.But then you at least you'll know what you're looking at.when you go to a therapist and they have these.Yeah, and maybe you'll buy some of these.Yeah Those for sure, actually.Yeah, I could see that.Well, we'll get to that Right.By the way, we're going to introduce.our skeleton again here.Napoleon Not Leopold.Napoleon Bone Apart.Oh yeah, Napoleon.And one of our patients thought it was fun.that she was going to go ahead and decorate it.And she's kind of creative in that regard.And it says I'm with these bone heads.So, I thought it was creative, anyway.Yeah I like what she's got down there.You can't, maybe you can't see that the knee,.she's got the the reflex hammer down there by the kneecap.Yeah And the weight tied into the hand.Yeah So, yeah.Yeah, we'll get him,.we'll get him rehabbed.Yep.All right So let's go ahead and start talking about.your hand after, maybe it was in a cast, you broke it.Sure.Maybe you have arthritis.Maybe you've had a stroke, something.It's weak It's not got the motion it should be.This is where you're going to start.Sure.Now, one of the things that you might try.if you have access to is a Parrafin Bath.This works out really well for someone who's having pain.Look at that, Brad's going to go ahead.We did a whole video on this.We won't take too much time on this right now,.but you just dip it in the Paraffin wax,.and it just envelopes the whole hand.and really provides a good source of heat.Really nice for arthritis.Really good for moisturizing the skin too.It feels great Bob did it last time.And I wanted to make sure I got in on this.[Bob] Brad wanted to get in on it, so.Yeah.[Bob] Alright While Brad's messing around with that,.why don't I go ahead and start off--.Oh, let me get the laundry done here first.Yeah Let's get that out of the way.If you are new to our channel,.I'm going to look over there.like I'm pretending someone just came in.Hi!.Please subscribe to us.We provide videos, how stay healthy, fit, pain free,.and we upload every day.Wow, wow What did you eat this morning?.I'm getting the energy level up here in the house.Holy cow.And also if you have a moment,.wander over to Facebook and like us.Please don't make us beg.We really want you to like us.Right, yeah We feel better.Yeah We feel better about ourselves whenever you do that.I feel better with my hand now This is great.So how are you going to do exercises now?.Well, just wait, Bob Let's start with this one.Yeah All right.We're going to start off.This is called the six pack.I went to, I did my schooling at the Mayo clinic,.and they used to call it the six pack there.I don't know if they invented it,.or it's just one that everybody uses.In Rochester, Minnesota.Yes Yeah.Let's do the six pack.All right, first one is six exercises.So you're going start off with what we call the tabletop.or some call it the duck.Does it look like a duck?.Let's just get on with it, Bob.All right So you go from that,.and then you can go to up to the claw, which is number two.Down, and number two.Now you can do these 10 times.Okay What's next Bob.Okay Now, this is called the P I P joint, right, Brad?.You're just going to bend that one.Ooh.So you know, these,.after an injury or a stroke or something of that nature,.these might be real difficult to do.Right.You may not be able to, you may have to--.You might only get partial way,.and then there's some more advanced things you can do.as far as, you know, holding one joint.and working on trying to get more bend to it.So next one, number four.Now this one you're going to go ahead.and just completely flex everything.and completely extend everything.Completely flex.Completely extend.Okay It's quiet in here today.Yeah, I like it.It's kind of nice.All right, the next one,.you're going to make an O with each finger.Oh, O!.Oh! (chuckles) O.Good.And then sometimes what they have you do.is slide to the bottom of this finger,.and then go back, start again.Oh Yeah.If you've got an itch on your finger,.you could itch it with your thumb like that.So.again, surprisingly Brad,.when you don't use the hand a lot in that certain fashion,.the hand actually gets tired.Yeah I can feel those muscles working.There is no doubt about it.All right, next one--.is the timer, right?.Yeah Oh yeah, it's right.Okay Next one, we're going to go ahead,.and last one, you're going to do.what we call finger abduction.So you're bringing the finger out like this.Now that my hand is warmed up from the wax, Bob,.I'm going to try it with this hand.Oh, look at that.It is amazing.Yeah.Even with a healthy hand, you could feel.how much more movable it is.Look at the erythema on there, by the way.Unfortunately, by the time this video is aired,.we are giving away one of these on Facebook,.which is another reason to like us on Facebook,.we give away a lot of stuff.But by the time this airs,.it's already going to be given away.Sorry Oh, bummer.Yeah All right.So, now that we've got the range of motion,.we're going to start doing some strengthening.And FEI has a whole bunch of strengthening things here,.there are kind of some standards here.This is the Digi-Flex.And this is the whole rack of them that they have.And it goes from the easiest one which is the tan one,.and each one of these little finger,.what would you call that?.(chuckles).See, we're not occupational therapists.They work with this more than,.by far, more than we do.Well, just this little knob here.It's like a trumpet.Well, it's for your finger.Yeah Yeah.For your finger flexors.So anyway, by pushing just the one finger,.that's just 075 pounds of pressure.Sure.If you do the whole hand, it's 25.Now moving up to like the red,.that's three pounds per finger.or 10 pounds per the hand.And if you go all the way to the most difficult one,.try even the gray one, Brad.These are very difficult.This is 13 pounds per finger, and I can't even--.Ooh Yeah, right.You know, I can't even hardly push that down.Right.And especially when you get down to the pinky.Yeah Yeah Oh my God That just--.But when you do all of them together,.it's amazing how much more, you know,.strength you can get with the cumulative--.Yeah, it pushes me to the limit though.You know, that's 43 pounds.Sure Right And so.It's got a nice contour here for the palm.So this is a set that,.it just works out really well for progression.He always puts them in upside down.Oh, did I put them in upside down?.Yeah Brad's,.Brad's more ofthat way.Yeah (chuckles).If you know what I mean?.All right, this is a Digi-Extend,.and this is just a real simple device.And what provides the resistance on here is rubber bands.I want to show some,.a lot of the different rubber bands, Brad.So, this is one of the easiest ones.And you can see, I can get all the fingers.and we're working on extending,.working on extending the fingers.And, you know, you can get more resistance.by using a heavier band.The darker the color typically,.and that's way it is on this product,.the darker the color, the more resistance.And you simply,.it takes a little time to change the rubber band out.So we're not gonna take the time to do that.And not that you have to necessarily change it.You could put two in it at the same time.Oh Sure, and double up the resistance.Yep, and the thing about that is,.yeah, now it's going to be really tough.Here, I just got it on Two of them, or one of them there.And that one is really working now.Right So.Yeah.So you can get plenty of resistance.Right.I don't care how tough you are.So the product that I really like Brad, is this Digi-Flex,.it's called, Multi-Progressive Exercise System.Yeah.This is really cool, and the reason it's really cool--.Now, again, we start with the yellow, which is only 15,.but you can interchange these.So if you're finding one of the fingers is a little bit weak.you can actually put in a heavier dose in there.So they just change easy, too.You just pull them out.I'm going to grab one of your black ones there.and slide it in, and you know, you're off and running.This is a beautiful set Right.I really love this.This is, you know, the interchangeable inserts here.And of course, again,.they're color coded by the resistance levels.And you can keep them arranged in here.So, you know,.this is something that at the professional level, you know,.occupational therapists or physical therapists.could really take advantage of for hand rehab.[Bob] To be honest, Brad, I already have,.my occupational therapist team has already been saying,.""Hey, can we get at this?"".And they have a patient they want to use it.Yeah, they want it.So I said, ""No, we have to do the video today"".And now after that, they're going to go ahead and grab it.So, all right.So, very cool.That's the, again, CanDo.This is the brand name of this, Brad, by the way.I like that Can-Do it.Yeah CanDo.Yeah Very positive.Digi-Flex Multi-Hand Exerciser.I wanted to make sure I got the name right.So, it's like a trumpet.That's what I was thinking.If you're a trumpet player and you're rehabbing,.this would be ideal (Bob laughing).It would.All right, the last one here,.you've got a little display tray here.Whoops Look at that Oh Bob.Why, Bob, why?.I didn't stick them in there hard enough.All right, this is the,.I want to, again, make sure I get it right,.the Digi-Extend and Squeeze.[Brad] Oh.[Bob] So what's nice about this.is that you're going to be able to work on flexion.and extension at the same time.Or, you know, you can work one then the other.But this is something you may want to buy.as a patient, even.[Brad] Yeah This is something I could see.Because you know,.what it has is, it's got five different firmnesses.That's what these five are.I want to push this in here to make sure.it's not going to do that same thing again.[Brad] So the darkest ball is much firmer foam rubber.Much firmer.And the lighter color yellow is much easier.Yeah, this one's a lot easier.So you'd start with the yellow.And as your hand gets stronger, progress up to the black.They also have three sizes,.and I don't know which size this is?.I don't know if this is the medium,.but they have small, medium, large.So you can figure out which one would work out.Right Depending on what size hand you have, of course.But let me just show you a few.of the exercises you can do with this.One, you can, of course, just do full flexion.You can work on just flexing the end, so the fingertips.Right Like this.So you get that pincher grip versus the full grip.And that's another one you can do, Brad,.is you can just do pincer like this.Sure Yep.You put the two fingers together.You can work pincer on each finger.Yep.You can actually work on just extension, of course.And then you can even hook in here.and work on flexion like this, you know, individually.So if you want to just work on flexion like this.Sure Yep.If you wanted to break it down that detailed.So there's a lot of different things you can do with that.So really cool set.Again, you can look at the website below.You know, right now, I'm afraid we've got to stop.and let our occupational therapists have their hand at it.(Brad chuckles).And remember, Brad and I can fix just about anything.Except for that broken heart.I don't know if this is going to help with that.But we are working on it Yeah, it might, you know.There you go.Okay Thanks","{'(0.36, 2.216)': '

VykLxY9mzug,"How to perform finger abduction to strengthen the fingers after an injury, stroke, cast removal, etc.?","(323, 344)", Okay Next one were going to go ahead.and last one youre going to do.what we call finger abduction.So youre bringing the finger out like this. Now that my hand is warmed up from the wax Bob.Im going to try it with this hand. Oh look at that. It is amazing. Yeah. Even with a healthy hand you could feel.how much more movable it is. Look at the erythema on there by the way," Bob and Brad   The two most famous   Physical therapists   On the internet  Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.And we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion, of course, Bob.I forgot to warm up Brad.Oh yeah.Okay, Brad, we're going to talk.about hand and finger exercises,.range of motion and strengthening that you can do.We're going to show you a progression,.show you some exercises you can do at home,.and then we're going to show you a set here.that was actually provided to us by FEI again.FEI.Fabrication Enterprises, Incorporated.This is their catalog If you are a therapist,.I would highly suggest that you grab one and get one.Sure.You can go to their website We'll put that link below.Right.But they gave us all this stuff.We're not getting paid for this.Right.But we don't get paid for anything, do we, Brad?.No, but we do,.we only like to represent quality or products that we like.They're good quality products,.and we feel good about giving a little bump to them.A little plug to them, yeah Mmm hmm.Okay.By the way, they provide some of these products.to retailers too and stuff.Sure.Yeah, these will probably use mostly for therapists.I don't think people are going to buy these.for an individual at home.if they had an accident or rehabbing.But then you at least you'll know what you're looking at.when you go to a therapist and they have these.Yeah, and maybe you'll buy some of these.Yeah Those for sure, actually.Yeah, I could see that.Well, we'll get to that Right.By the way, we're going to introduce.our skeleton again here.Napoleon Not Leopold.Napoleon Bone Apart.Oh yeah, Napoleon.And one of our patients thought it was fun.that she was going to go ahead and decorate it.And she's kind of creative in that regard.And it says I'm with these bone heads.So, I thought it was creative, anyway.Yeah I like what she's got down there.You can't, maybe you can't see that the knee,.she's got the the reflex hammer down there by the kneecap.Yeah And the weight tied into the hand.Yeah So, yeah.Yeah, we'll get him,.we'll get him rehabbed.Yep.All right So let's go ahead and start talking about.your hand after, maybe it was in a cast, you broke it.Sure.Maybe you have arthritis.Maybe you've had a stroke, something.It's weak It's not got the motion it should be.This is where you're going to start.Sure.Now, one of the things that you might try.if you have access to is a Parrafin Bath.This works out really well for someone who's having pain.Look at that, Brad's going to go ahead.We did a whole video on this.We won't take too much time on this right now,.but you just dip it in the Paraffin wax,.and it just envelopes the whole hand.and really provides a good source of heat.Really nice for arthritis.Really good for moisturizing the skin too.It feels great Bob did it last time.And I wanted to make sure I got in on this.[Bob] Brad wanted to get in on it, so.Yeah.[Bob] Alright While Brad's messing around with that,.why don't I go ahead and start off--.Oh, let me get the laundry done here first.Yeah Let's get that out of the way.If you are new to our channel,.I'm going to look over there.like I'm pretending someone just came in.Hi!.Please subscribe to us.We provide videos, how stay healthy, fit, pain free,.and we upload every day.Wow, wow What did you eat this morning?.I'm getting the energy level up here in the house.Holy cow.And also if you have a moment,.wander over to Facebook and like us.Please don't make us beg.We really want you to like us.Right, yeah We feel better.Yeah We feel better about ourselves whenever you do that.I feel better with my hand now This is great.So how are you going to do exercises now?.Well, just wait, Bob Let's start with this one.Yeah All right.We're going to start off.This is called the six pack.I went to, I did my schooling at the Mayo clinic,.and they used to call it the six pack there.I don't know if they invented it,.or it's just one that everybody uses.In Rochester, Minnesota.Yes Yeah.Let's do the six pack.All right, first one is six exercises.So you're going start off with what we call the tabletop.or some call it the duck.Does it look like a duck?.Let's just get on with it, Bob.All right So you go from that,.and then you can go to up to the claw, which is number two.Down, and number two.Now you can do these 10 times.Okay What's next Bob.Okay Now, this is called the P I P joint, right, Brad?.You're just going to bend that one.Ooh.So you know, these,.after an injury or a stroke or something of that nature,.these might be real difficult to do.Right.You may not be able to, you may have to--.You might only get partial way,.and then there's some more advanced things you can do.as far as, you know, holding one joint.and working on trying to get more bend to it.So next one, number four.Now this one you're going to go ahead.and just completely flex everything.and completely extend everything.Completely flex.Completely extend.Okay It's quiet in here today.Yeah, I like it.It's kind of nice.All right, the next one,.you're going to make an O with each finger.Oh, O!.Oh! (chuckles) O.Good.And then sometimes what they have you do.is slide to the bottom of this finger,.and then go back, start again.Oh Yeah.If you've got an itch on your finger,.you could itch it with your thumb like that.So.again, surprisingly Brad,.when you don't use the hand a lot in that certain fashion,.the hand actually gets tired.Yeah I can feel those muscles working.There is no doubt about it.All right, next one--.is the timer, right?.Yeah Oh yeah, it's right.Okay Next one, we're going to go ahead,.and last one, you're going to do.what we call finger abduction.So you're bringing the finger out like this.Now that my hand is warmed up from the wax, Bob,.I'm going to try it with this hand.Oh, look at that.It is amazing.Yeah.Even with a healthy hand, you could feel.how much more movable it is.Look at the erythema on there, by the way.Unfortunately, by the time this video is aired,.we are giving away one of these on Facebook,.which is another reason to like us on Facebook,.we give away a lot of stuff.But by the time this airs,.it's already going to be given away.Sorry Oh, bummer.Yeah All right.So, now that we've got the range of motion,.we're going to start doing some strengthening.And FEI has a whole bunch of strengthening things here,.there are kind of some standards here.This is the Digi-Flex.And this is the whole rack of them that they have.And it goes from the easiest one which is the tan one,.and each one of these little finger,.what would you call that?.(chuckles).See, we're not occupational therapists.They work with this more than,.by far, more than we do.Well, just this little knob here.It's like a trumpet.Well, it's for your finger.Yeah Yeah.For your finger flexors.So anyway, by pushing just the one finger,.that's just 075 pounds of pressure.Sure.If you do the whole hand, it's 25.Now moving up to like the red,.that's three pounds per finger.or 10 pounds per the hand.And if you go all the way to the most difficult one,.try even the gray one, Brad.These are very difficult.This is 13 pounds per finger, and I can't even--.Ooh Yeah, right.You know, I can't even hardly push that down.Right.And especially when you get down to the pinky.Yeah Yeah Oh my God That just--.But when you do all of them together,.it's amazing how much more, you know,.strength you can get with the cumulative--.Yeah, it pushes me to the limit though.You know, that's 43 pounds.Sure Right And so.It's got a nice contour here for the palm.So this is a set that,.it just works out really well for progression.He always puts them in upside down.Oh, did I put them in upside down?.Yeah Brad's,.Brad's more ofthat way.Yeah (chuckles).If you know what I mean?.All right, this is a Digi-Extend,.and this is just a real simple device.And what provides the resistance on here is rubber bands.I want to show some,.a lot of the different rubber bands, Brad.So, this is one of the easiest ones.And you can see, I can get all the fingers.and we're working on extending,.working on extending the fingers.And, you know, you can get more resistance.by using a heavier band.The darker the color typically,.and that's way it is on this product,.the darker the color, the more resistance.And you simply,.it takes a little time to change the rubber band out.So we're not gonna take the time to do that.And not that you have to necessarily change it.You could put two in it at the same time.Oh Sure, and double up the resistance.Yep, and the thing about that is,.yeah, now it's going to be really tough.Here, I just got it on Two of them, or one of them there.And that one is really working now.Right So.Yeah.So you can get plenty of resistance.Right.I don't care how tough you are.So the product that I really like Brad, is this Digi-Flex,.it's called, Multi-Progressive Exercise System.Yeah.This is really cool, and the reason it's really cool--.Now, again, we start with the yellow, which is only 15,.but you can interchange these.So if you're finding one of the fingers is a little bit weak.you can actually put in a heavier dose in there.So they just change easy, too.You just pull them out.I'm going to grab one of your black ones there.and slide it in, and you know, you're off and running.This is a beautiful set Right.I really love this.This is, you know, the interchangeable inserts here.And of course, again,.they're color coded by the resistance levels.And you can keep them arranged in here.So, you know,.this is something that at the professional level, you know,.occupational therapists or physical therapists.could really take advantage of for hand rehab.[Bob] To be honest, Brad, I already have,.my occupational therapist team has already been saying,.""Hey, can we get at this?"".And they have a patient they want to use it.Yeah, they want it.So I said, ""No, we have to do the video today"".And now after that, they're going to go ahead and grab it.So, all right.So, very cool.That's the, again, CanDo.This is the brand name of this, Brad, by the way.I like that Can-Do it.Yeah CanDo.Yeah Very positive.Digi-Flex Multi-Hand Exerciser.I wanted to make sure I got the name right.So, it's like a trumpet.That's what I was thinking.If you're a trumpet player and you're rehabbing,.this would be ideal (Bob laughing).It would.All right, the last one here,.you've got a little display tray here.Whoops Look at that Oh Bob.Why, Bob, why?.I didn't stick them in there hard enough.All right, this is the,.I want to, again, make sure I get it right,.the Digi-Extend and Squeeze.[Brad] Oh.[Bob] So what's nice about this.is that you're going to be able to work on flexion.and extension at the same time.Or, you know, you can work one then the other.But this is something you may want to buy.as a patient, even.[Brad] Yeah This is something I could see.Because you know,.what it has is, it's got five different firmnesses.That's what these five are.I want to push this in here to make sure.it's not going to do that same thing again.[Brad] So the darkest ball is much firmer foam rubber.Much firmer.And the lighter color yellow is much easier.Yeah, this one's a lot easier.So you'd start with the yellow.And as your hand gets stronger, progress up to the black.They also have three sizes,.and I don't know which size this is?.I don't know if this is the medium,.but they have small, medium, large.So you can figure out which one would work out.Right Depending on what size hand you have, of course.But let me just show you a few.of the exercises you can do with this.One, you can, of course, just do full flexion.You can work on just flexing the end, so the fingertips.Right Like this.So you get that pincher grip versus the full grip.And that's another one you can do, Brad,.is you can just do pincer like this.Sure Yep.You put the two fingers together.You can work pincer on each finger.Yep.You can actually work on just extension, of course.And then you can even hook in here.and work on flexion like this, you know, individually.So if you want to just work on flexion like this.Sure Yep.If you wanted to break it down that detailed.So there's a lot of different things you can do with that.So really cool set.Again, you can look at the website below.You know, right now, I'm afraid we've got to stop.and let our occupational therapists have their hand at it.(Brad chuckles).And remember, Brad and I can fix just about anything.Except for that broken heart.I don't know if this is going to help with that.But we are working on it Yeah, it might, you know.There you go.Okay Thanks","{'(0.36, 2.216)': '

9s3geiwg1AA,How to use the Clark's sign test to identify patellofemoral pain?,"(83, 141)",Just kidding. One test that we do Brad by the way.is called Clarks sign.or I think its patella grinding test. Sure. Do you wanna just roll up your pant leg Brad. Oh do I ever Bob. So lets go ahead and get this stool over here this.I would do this.He would be laying flat on the bed. Okay. But what I do is I usually tell him.to first go ahead and tighten the knee.or push the knee down into the bed.Yep like that.And I tell him to do it very slow.Okay and then I go ahead and I put my hand right here. Yep. Relax first. Okay. And then I go ahead and now tighten the knee. So now Im pulling my knee cap is gonna go.up towards my stomach. And if thats positive it is gonna be painful. Okay. All right now thats painful in some people.Is it painful on you. No but it feels a little weird. Yeah. But it I was like maybe its gonna hurt.but it really didnt. The correlation is a little questionable sometimes.but its to me its at least one of the signs," Bob and Brad   the two most famous   physical therapists   on the internet  Hi folks.I'm Bob Shrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.And we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion, of course, Bob.Brad, today I wanted to talk about patellofemoral pain.and chondromalacia.Got some great self-help techniques and treatments.and exercises you can do for this problem.Techniques, having a hard time pronouncing that one.Did I say that weird?.No, no, you're doing fine.What are you smiling about?.(laughing).All right, this is Napoleon Bone Apart.Isn't that funny, Brad?.Ha ha ha.= All right, so today we're gonna show you generally.with patellofemoral pain syndrome is what they call it.You're having pain on the front part of the knee here.A lot of times around the kneecap, it often catches.It doesn't usually lock.but you might get this catching sensation.You might also get some grinding.Sure.And hear some popping even.Oftentimes going up and particularly downstairs.Yeah, very good point, Brad.Going on hilly surfaces, worse going down.The stresses on your knee are higher going down.I just saw a study on that.Yeah, I believe it.I believe it, Bob.So what you're gonna wanna do is also.what we call the movie goer sign, by the way, Brad.Oh, yes.If you're watching a movie and your knees are bent.like this, you know, for a long period of time.you start having increased pain with that.Yeah, so quit watching movies.Just kidding.One test that we do, Brad, by the way,.is called Clark's sign.or I think it's patella grinding test.Sure.Do you wanna just roll up your pant leg, Brad?.Oh, do I ever Bob.So let's go ahead and get this stool over here, this.I would do this.He would be laying flat on the bed.Okay.But what I do is I usually tell him.to first, go ahead and tighten the knee.or push the knee down into the bed.Yep, like that.And I tell him to do it very slow.Okay, and then I go ahead and I put my hand right here.Yep.Relax first.Okay.And then I go ahead and now tighten the knee.So now I'm pulling, my knee cap is gonna go.up towards my stomach.And if that's positive, it is gonna be painful.Okay.All right, now that's painful in some people.Is it painful on you?.No, but it feels a little weird.Yeah.But it I was like maybe it's gonna hurt,.but it really didn't.The correlation is a little questionable sometimes.but it's, to me, it's at least one of the signs.that you have.Sure, mm-hmm.The other signs is what.Later I'm gonna show you how to tape it.If the taping feels better,.To me, that's often a good sign.that it's patellofemoral syndrome.Right But you're gonna show that later.Yeah.Okay Bob, there's one more thing.We got some new people out there.that maybe haven't heard of our show before.Yeah, if you've never watched one of our channel-.watched our channel before,.even if you have, please take a second to subscribe.We got a subscribe button here.over here on the left hand side, left of Brad.And we provide videos on stay healthy, fit, pain free.and we upload every day.Say no more Bob, back to the knee.So what's happening with patellofemoral syndrome.or chondromalacia.is that.you got the kneecap here.and it normally.let's go on this side.I took the kneecap off on this side.You see this little canal here?.The kneecap doesn't just stay static.It actually is moving up and down.in this little canal here.Is that called the femoral groove?.Yep.Mm-hmm.So as we're going, it's moving up and along.in the femoral groove here.and what happens with patellofemoral syndrome quite often.is that it gets a little bit off track.It's not lining like it should.It's not lined up there.It's not lined up like it should.And you can see these are sharp edges here, Brad.Oh yeah.So if you, if the patella.which is a little bit soft underneath it,.as it gets over on the side here.it can actually wear out the underside of the patella.And that's the chondromalacia part of it.Sure.I mean, softening of the kneecap.Right.So what we wanna do is get it back.into the groove here and have it stay there.so it can calm down and not give you so much pain.or give you that grinding or that catching.Right You know that that's a joint actually cartilage.and you want the large surfaces rubbing against each other.as opposed to that edge Bob was talking about.Now, they used to think, Brad,.that if your knee was a little bit bent like this,.that Q angle, like on women, that that causes this.but now they finding out that's really not the case.Okay.But they are finding out.that you, if you have flat feet.that that does tend to contribute to it.So if you have flat feet.when you put weight, it changes the mechanics.so that you're more predisposed to that.Yeah It's not tracking right.Also they don't like the hip to be internally rotated.Like when you're doing sports.you don't want your leg in like this.that can predispose you to causing the knee pain.Sure.And not traveling the way it should.All right, let's talk about the first treatments.we're gonna do here, Brad.So the first thing we're gonna do.is you're just gonna go ahead and make sure you're icing.I mean, you know.Cold pack.Just get the ice pack, cold pack.after you've been doing sports.Let's try to get it to calm down.And typically you're gonna do that with a straight knee.You're not gonna have it bent, I'm assuming,.so that there's less stress on it if there at all.Well, or maybe in the loose pack position.Sure.Maybe slight flexion with,.I'd go ahead and do it in that way.The next thing I wanna do is I want you to go ahead.and start stretching that, the patella.Okay.So you're actually gonna go ahead and here's your kneecap,.and you're gonna actually, Brad,.you can do it on yours and I can do it on mine,.but you're gonna go ahead and it's gotta be relaxed.You're usually laying flat.and you're gonna go ahead and you're gonna push the patella.So here's the kneecap.I'm gonna push it down.I'm gonna push it up.And I'm also gonna push it towards the other knee.Yep.Towards the in central medial.So you gotta be relaxed to do this,.but you you see I'm pushing down.You're gonna feel it.You wanna feel the kneecap actually move.and then you're gonna also push up.Yeah, I'll see if they can get a different view this way.It's kind of hard 'cause my skid's moving all over.But you know, when I was a PT student, I had no idea.that the kneecap moved this much.Yeah.If you, if your quads are completely relaxed,.it really, you can really.move your kneecap around quite a bit.Well, and that's the problem.is some of you who have this.may not be able to move your kneecap very much.It may be very tight.These structures, you know, the quad may be tight.The patella tendon may be tight.The IT band, as it comes in here, may be all tight.Sure.The lateral structures.So that's what you're starting to do.is you're starting to do these stretches.and you can do this.I have a girl right now who's doing this.and she's in class and she's doing this while she's-.Sure.She's listening to her teacher.So you told her if you're getting bored with class.Yeah.Mobilize your kneecap.I actually you her do some straight leg raises.'cause we're gonna have her do some strengthening too.Now the probably the most standard treatment.that therapists do now for patellofemoral syndrome.is the McConnell taping.Sure.So Brad, do you wanna stay?.Yes I do.So what we're doing with this.is very simply we're gonna take the kneecap.and now I know all the therapists.that peer us out there are gonna be screaming at me here,.while the kneecap could be tilted, it could be rotated.But I have found out that with most people,.if they just try and push the kneecap over.and tape it over towards the other kneecap.Mm-hmm.And see if it feels better.Why not just try that first?.Try the simple, the simple remedy first.And this is for, for people at home.this is what all you really can do.And if it works, it works.If it doesn't work, no harm.Take it off, yeah.No harm done.Just a cost of a little bit of tape.Right.And why not give it a try?.So Brad, normally what we do is, and sometimes, you know.like if you get a McConnell taping technique.there's actually material.or that wipes they can do beforehand.Pre wipe, yep.Because the skin can get very irritated.with this taping.Sure.Some people are more predisposed.That was the other thing.This girl I had, she was keeping her tape on for a week.and a trainer had told her to do this.Sure.Oh my God, I took it off.It was red.The skin had started to break down.Yeah.So nobody can keep tape on for a week.They all really recommend 24 hours.I've seen some go 48, but.Mm-hmm.If you're allergic to it,.you're probably gonna start turning red.within a few hours.So if that happens,.get the tape off right away.And this is not an option for you.Even if you're not allergic to it,.you can build up kind of the allergy to it over, I mean.Right.A reaction to it over time.because I've seen people that I've taped for weeks.And then by the fifth week it starts getting irritated.Yeah.And usually you hope you don't have to go that long.Right.So I put an underlying underlayment tape down first.This is hypoallergenic.and I'm not really doing anything with that.Mm-hmm.But the other piece of tape, what I'm doing is-.Sometimes I'll pull that a little bit.I, I sometimes will.I usually do.Now sometimes if, if you got, you know,.someone with hairy legs,.you might wanna shave.but I'm, I'm not gonna shave my legs.Yeah, he does that on his own personal time.(laughing).So what I do here now is I usually push the kneecap over.So I'm pushing it over towards the other knee.That's usually the direction you wanna try.and I'll put the tape right on the edge of the kneecap.Sure.And I'll push it over and while I'm pushing it over.I'll pull on the tape at the same time.Yep.And you actually might get a little wrinkled.up in there in the skin and that's fine.Yep.And I usually like to do a double one, Brad.Okay.I'll sometimes make mine a little bit longer.just so it has more sticky and it has less apt to wrinkles.I agree, I agree.It should go around here.And then sometimes I'll put some tape.over the top of it to stop the edges from catching.Yeah.But again, I push over, I'm on the edge of the kneecap.I'm pushing pretty good on it, Brad.Yep.And then I pull and wrap it and the test,.you know this is a good test.A lot of times, Brad, what we'll do.Brad and I both will have somebody walk upstairs.without the tape on.And they'll say, how bad was the pain?.They'll say maybe it was a five out of 10.Sure.And then we put the tape on,.we have 'em go up and down the stairs.and we have 'em check it.And a lot of times the pain has decreased.Right, it may go down to as much as one or two.or they say, oh, that's clearly better.Then you know, you're on the right track.All right, other things you can do, if you have flat feet.you may want to get arch support.'cause that might help a bit.Sure.But let's go into some.of the strengthening exercises, Brad.One of the first ones I'm gonna have people do,.I'm gonna go, is just go ahead.and good old, straight leg raises.So you can go ahead and I'm strengthening this one here.I'm just gonna go ahead and lift up like this.and I'm go ahead and.we're getting some strengthening of the quad.Right.Lot of times on this.it's more comfortable lay down flat.Sure, you can lay down flat.But Bob's head will fall off the back of the table.The latest research is they want,.you wanna strengthen the knee extensors.Mm-hmm.The hip abductors.So I'm gonna lay on my side and I'm gonna just bend this leg.and I'm gonna work on doing these.which you can do with weight.or you can do without weight.So we're working these muscles up here.And the hip external rotators.So I'm gonna do clamshells.I'm putting my knees together like this.and I'm going like this.There you go.So why don't you turn this way?.So they can see it from both directions.You're gonna.Well it's gonna be the wrong leg.and it's gonna be by mic, but.So yeah, here's hip abductors.and here's clamshells, hip external rotators.And normally, he can't.because he's gonna go on his mic box there.but you lay down flat with a pillow and be comfortable.So the eventual thing too, Brad.is I usually try to teach people how to hop eventually.And, and that is, you know, when they're,.when they're standing, like they don't wanna hop.and land like this.Right.They wanna learn to land correctly.like this once the knee pain has gone away.Right.So the knees don't jet in towards each other.You go to the side and back,.forward and back,.keeping the knees, you know,.the knees are not going past the feet.They're, they're staying in that good athletic position.So those are some of the things to keep in mind.And when you go back to athletics, remember, you know.you're gonna start off gradually.Run on flat surfaces, not hills.Avoid the steps and all that, so.Right.Thanks for watching, folks.Good job, Bob.Thanks.Here's a nice kneecap right here Look at this","{'(155.634, 156.46699999999998)':  'Right', '(406.767, 408.927)': '(laughing)', '(27.45,

9s3geiwg1AA,How to treat patellofemoral pain by pushing the knee cap?,"(306, 385)",Id go ahead and do it in that way.The next thing I wanna do is I want you to go ahead.and start stretching that the patella. Okay. So youre actually gonna go ahead and heres your kneecap.and youre gonna actually Brad.you can do it on yours and I can do it on mine.but youre gonna go ahead and its gotta be relaxed.Youre usually laying flat.and youre gonna go ahead and youre gonna push the patella.So heres the kneecap.Im gonna push it down.Im gonna push it up.And Im also gonna push it towards the other knee. Yep.Towards the in central medial. So you gotta be relaxed to do this.but you you see Im pushing down.Youre gonna feel it.You wanna feel the kneecap actually move.and then youre gonna also push up. Yeah Ill see if they can get a different view this way.Its kind of hard cause my skids moving all over.But you know when I was a PT student I had no idea.that the kneecap moved this much. Yeah. If you if your quads are completely relaxed.it really you can really.move your kneecap around quite a bit. Well and thats the problem.is some of you who have this.may not be able to move your kneecap very much.It may be very tight.These structures you know the quad may be tight.The patella tendon may be tight.The IT band as it comes in here may be all tight. Sure. The lateral structures.So thats what youre starting to do.is youre starting to do these stretches.and you can do this.I have a girl right now whos doing this.and shes in class and shes doing this while shes. Sure. Shes listening to her teacher. So you told her if youre getting bored with class," Bob and Brad   the two most famous   physical therapists   on the internet  Hi folks.I'm Bob Shrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.And we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion, of course, Bob.Brad, today I wanted to talk about patellofemoral pain.and chondromalacia.Got some great self-help techniques and treatments.and exercises you can do for this problem.Techniques, having a hard time pronouncing that one.Did I say that weird?.No, no, you're doing fine.What are you smiling about?.(laughing).All right, this is Napoleon Bone Apart.Isn't that funny, Brad?.Ha ha ha.= All right, so today we're gonna show you generally.with patellofemoral pain syndrome is what they call it.You're having pain on the front part of the knee here.A lot of times around the kneecap, it often catches.It doesn't usually lock.but you might get this catching sensation.You might also get some grinding.Sure.And hear some popping even.Oftentimes going up and particularly downstairs.Yeah, very good point, Brad.Going on hilly surfaces, worse going down.The stresses on your knee are higher going down.I just saw a study on that.Yeah, I believe it.I believe it, Bob.So what you're gonna wanna do is also.what we call the movie goer sign, by the way, Brad.Oh, yes.If you're watching a movie and your knees are bent.like this, you know, for a long period of time.you start having increased pain with that.Yeah, so quit watching movies.Just kidding.One test that we do, Brad, by the way,.is called Clark's sign.or I think it's patella grinding test.Sure.Do you wanna just roll up your pant leg, Brad?.Oh, do I ever Bob.So let's go ahead and get this stool over here, this.I would do this.He would be laying flat on the bed.Okay.But what I do is I usually tell him.to first, go ahead and tighten the knee.or push the knee down into the bed.Yep, like that.And I tell him to do it very slow.Okay, and then I go ahead and I put my hand right here.Yep.Relax first.Okay.And then I go ahead and now tighten the knee.So now I'm pulling, my knee cap is gonna go.up towards my stomach.And if that's positive, it is gonna be painful.Okay.All right, now that's painful in some people.Is it painful on you?.No, but it feels a little weird.Yeah.But it I was like maybe it's gonna hurt,.but it really didn't.The correlation is a little questionable sometimes.but it's, to me, it's at least one of the signs.that you have.Sure, mm-hmm.The other signs is what.Later I'm gonna show you how to tape it.If the taping feels better,.To me, that's often a good sign.that it's patellofemoral syndrome.Right But you're gonna show that later.Yeah.Okay Bob, there's one more thing.We got some new people out there.that maybe haven't heard of our show before.Yeah, if you've never watched one of our channel-.watched our channel before,.even if you have, please take a second to subscribe.We got a subscribe button here.over here on the left hand side, left of Brad.And we provide videos on stay healthy, fit, pain free.and we upload every day.Say no more Bob, back to the knee.So what's happening with patellofemoral syndrome.or chondromalacia.is that.you got the kneecap here.and it normally.let's go on this side.I took the kneecap off on this side.You see this little canal here?.The kneecap doesn't just stay static.It actually is moving up and down.in this little canal here.Is that called the femoral groove?.Yep.Mm-hmm.So as we're going, it's moving up and along.in the femoral groove here.and what happens with patellofemoral syndrome quite often.is that it gets a little bit off track.It's not lining like it should.It's not lined up there.It's not lined up like it should.And you can see these are sharp edges here, Brad.Oh yeah.So if you, if the patella.which is a little bit soft underneath it,.as it gets over on the side here.it can actually wear out the underside of the patella.And that's the chondromalacia part of it.Sure.I mean, softening of the kneecap.Right.So what we wanna do is get it back.into the groove here and have it stay there.so it can calm down and not give you so much pain.or give you that grinding or that catching.Right You know that that's a joint actually cartilage.and you want the large surfaces rubbing against each other.as opposed to that edge Bob was talking about.Now, they used to think, Brad,.that if your knee was a little bit bent like this,.that Q angle, like on women, that that causes this.but now they finding out that's really not the case.Okay.But they are finding out.that you, if you have flat feet.that that does tend to contribute to it.So if you have flat feet.when you put weight, it changes the mechanics.so that you're more predisposed to that.Yeah It's not tracking right.Also they don't like the hip to be internally rotated.Like when you're doing sports.you don't want your leg in like this.that can predispose you to causing the knee pain.Sure.And not traveling the way it should.All right, let's talk about the first treatments.we're gonna do here, Brad.So the first thing we're gonna do.is you're just gonna go ahead and make sure you're icing.I mean, you know.Cold pack.Just get the ice pack, cold pack.after you've been doing sports.Let's try to get it to calm down.And typically you're gonna do that with a straight knee.You're not gonna have it bent, I'm assuming,.so that there's less stress on it if there at all.Well, or maybe in the loose pack position.Sure.Maybe slight flexion with,.I'd go ahead and do it in that way.The next thing I wanna do is I want you to go ahead.and start stretching that, the patella.Okay.So you're actually gonna go ahead and here's your kneecap,.and you're gonna actually, Brad,.you can do it on yours and I can do it on mine,.but you're gonna go ahead and it's gotta be relaxed.You're usually laying flat.and you're gonna go ahead and you're gonna push the patella.So here's the kneecap.I'm gonna push it down.I'm gonna push it up.And I'm also gonna push it towards the other knee.Yep.Towards the in central medial.So you gotta be relaxed to do this,.but you you see I'm pushing down.You're gonna feel it.You wanna feel the kneecap actually move.and then you're gonna also push up.Yeah, I'll see if they can get a different view this way.It's kind of hard 'cause my skid's moving all over.But you know, when I was a PT student, I had no idea.that the kneecap moved this much.Yeah.If you, if your quads are completely relaxed,.it really, you can really.move your kneecap around quite a bit.Well, and that's the problem.is some of you who have this.may not be able to move your kneecap very much.It may be very tight.These structures, you know, the quad may be tight.The patella tendon may be tight.The IT band, as it comes in here, may be all tight.Sure.The lateral structures.So that's what you're starting to do.is you're starting to do these stretches.and you can do this.I have a girl right now who's doing this.and she's in class and she's doing this while she's-.Sure.She's listening to her teacher.So you told her if you're getting bored with class.Yeah.Mobilize your kneecap.I actually you her do some straight leg raises.'cause we're gonna have her do some strengthening too.Now the probably the most standard treatment.that therapists do now for patellofemoral syndrome.is the McConnell taping.Sure.So Brad, do you wanna stay?.Yes I do.So what we're doing with this.is very simply we're gonna take the kneecap.and now I know all the therapists.that peer us out there are gonna be screaming at me here,.while the kneecap could be tilted, it could be rotated.But I have found out that with most people,.if they just try and push the kneecap over.and tape it over towards the other kneecap.Mm-hmm.And see if it feels better.Why not just try that first?.Try the simple, the simple remedy first.And this is for, for people at home.this is what all you really can do.And if it works, it works.If it doesn't work, no harm.Take it off, yeah.No harm done.Just a cost of a little bit of tape.Right.And why not give it a try?.So Brad, normally what we do is, and sometimes, you know.like if you get a McConnell taping technique.there's actually material.or that wipes they can do beforehand.Pre wipe, yep.Because the skin can get very irritated.with this taping.Sure.Some people are more predisposed.That was the other thing.This girl I had, she was keeping her tape on for a week.and a trainer had told her to do this.Sure.Oh my God, I took it off.It was red.The skin had started to break down.Yeah.So nobody can keep tape on for a week.They all really recommend 24 hours.I've seen some go 48, but.Mm-hmm.If you're allergic to it,.you're probably gonna start turning red.within a few hours.So if that happens,.get the tape off right away.And this is not an option for you.Even if you're not allergic to it,.you can build up kind of the allergy to it over, I mean.Right.A reaction to it over time.because I've seen people that I've taped for weeks.And then by the fifth week it starts getting irritated.Yeah.And usually you hope you don't have to go that long.Right.So I put an underlying underlayment tape down first.This is hypoallergenic.and I'm not really doing anything with that.Mm-hmm.But the other piece of tape, what I'm doing is-.Sometimes I'll pull that a little bit.I, I sometimes will.I usually do.Now sometimes if, if you got, you know,.someone with hairy legs,.you might wanna shave.but I'm, I'm not gonna shave my legs.Yeah, he does that on his own personal time.(laughing).So what I do here now is I usually push the kneecap over.So I'm pushing it over towards the other knee.That's usually the direction you wanna try.and I'll put the tape right on the edge of the kneecap.Sure.And I'll push it over and while I'm pushing it over.I'll pull on the tape at the same time.Yep.And you actually might get a little wrinkled.up in there in the skin and that's fine.Yep.And I usually like to do a double one, Brad.Okay.I'll sometimes make mine a little bit longer.just so it has more sticky and it has less apt to wrinkles.I agree, I agree.It should go around here.And then sometimes I'll put some tape.over the top of it to stop the edges from catching.Yeah.But again, I push over, I'm on the edge of the kneecap.I'm pushing pretty good on it, Brad.Yep.And then I pull and wrap it and the test,.you know this is a good test.A lot of times, Brad, what we'll do.Brad and I both will have somebody walk upstairs.without the tape on.And they'll say, how bad was the pain?.They'll say maybe it was a five out of 10.Sure.And then we put the tape on,.we have 'em go up and down the stairs.and we have 'em check it.And a lot of times the pain has decreased.Right, it may go down to as much as one or two.or they say, oh, that's clearly better.Then you know, you're on the right track.All right, other things you can do, if you have flat feet.you may want to get arch support.'cause that might help a bit.Sure.But let's go into some.of the strengthening exercises, Brad.One of the first ones I'm gonna have people do,.I'm gonna go, is just go ahead.and good old, straight leg raises.So you can go ahead and I'm strengthening this one here.I'm just gonna go ahead and lift up like this.and I'm go ahead and.we're getting some strengthening of the quad.Right.Lot of times on this.it's more comfortable lay down flat.Sure, you can lay down flat.But Bob's head will fall off the back of the table.The latest research is they want,.you wanna strengthen the knee extensors.Mm-hmm.The hip abductors.So I'm gonna lay on my side and I'm gonna just bend this leg.and I'm gonna work on doing these.which you can do with weight.or you can do without weight.So we're working these muscles up here.And the hip external rotators.So I'm gonna do clamshells.I'm putting my knees together like this.and I'm going like this.There you go.So why don't you turn this way?.So they can see it from both directions.You're gonna.Well it's gonna be the wrong leg.and it's gonna be by mic, but.So yeah, here's hip abductors.and here's clamshells, hip external rotators.And normally, he can't.because he's gonna go on his mic box there.but you lay down flat with a pillow and be comfortable.So the eventual thing too, Brad.is I usually try to teach people how to hop eventually.And, and that is, you know, when they're,.when they're standing, like they don't wanna hop.and land like this.Right.They wanna learn to land correctly.like this once the knee pain has gone away.Right.So the knees don't jet in towards each other.You go to the side and back,.forward and back,.keeping the knees, you know,.the knees are not going past the feet.They're, they're staying in that good athletic position.So those are some of the things to keep in mind.And when you go back to athletics, remember, you know.you're gonna start off gradually.Run on flat surfaces, not hills.Avoid the steps and all that, so.Right.Thanks for watching, folks.Good job, Bob.Thanks.Here's a nice kneecap right here Look at this","{'(155.634,

9s3geiwg1AA,How to treat patellofemoral pain by taping the knee cap?,"(392, 586)",Now the probably the most standard treatment.that therapists do now for patellofemoral syndrome.is the McConnell taping. Sure. So Brad do you wanna stay. Yes I do. So what were doing with this.is very simply were gonna take the kneecap.and now I know all the therapists.that peer us out there are gonna be screaming at me here.while the kneecap could be tilted it could be rotated.But I have found out that with most people.if they just try and push the kneecap over.and tape it over towards the other kneecap. Mmhmm. And see if it feels better.Why not just try that first.Try the simple the simple remedy first. And this is for for people at home.this is what all you really can do.And if it works it works.If it doesnt work no harm. Take it off yeah. No harm done. Just a cost of a little bit of tape. Right. And why not give it a try.So Brad normally what we do is and sometimes you know.like if you get a McConnell taping technique.theres actually material.or that wipes they can do beforehand. Pre wipe yep. Because the skin can get very irritated.with this taping. Sure. Some people are more predisposed.That was the other thing.This girl I had she was keeping her tape on for a week.and a trainer had told her to do this. Sure. Oh my God I took it off.It was red.The skin had started to break down. Yeah. So nobody can keep tape on for a week.They all really recommend 24 hours.Ive seen some go 48 but. Mmhmm.If youre allergic to it.youre probably gonna start turning red.within a few hours.So if that happens.get the tape off right away.And this is not an option for you.Even if youre not allergic to it.you can build up kind of the allergy to it over I mean. Right. A reaction to it over time.because Ive seen people that Ive taped for weeks.And then by the fifth week it starts getting irritated. Yeah. And usually you hope you dont have to go that long. Right. So I put an underlying underlayment tape down first.This is hypoallergenic.and Im not really doing anything with that. Mmhmm. But the other piece of tape what Im doing is. Sometimes Ill pull that a little bit. I I sometimes will.I usually do. Now sometimes if if you got you know.someone with hairy legs.you might wanna shave.but Im Im not gonna shave my legs. Yeah he does that on his own personal time.laughing.So what I do here now is I usually push the kneecap over.So Im pushing it over towards the other knee.Thats usually the direction you wanna try.and Ill put the tape right on the edge of the kneecap. Sure. And Ill push it over and while Im pushing it over.Ill pull on the tape at the same time. Yep. And you actually might get a little wrinkled.up in there in the skin and thats fine. Yep. And I usually like to do a double one Brad. Okay.Ill sometimes make mine a little bit longer.just so it has more sticky and it has less apt to wrinkles. I agree I agree.It should go around here.And then sometimes Ill put some tape.over the top of it to stop the edges from catching. Yeah. But again I push over Im on the edge of the kneecap.Im pushing pretty good on it Brad. Yep. And then I pull and wrap it and the test.you know this is a good test.A lot of times Brad what well do.Brad and I both will have somebody walk upstairs.without the tape on.And theyll say how bad was the pain.Theyll say maybe it was a five out of 10. Sure. And then we put the tape on.we have em go up and down the stairs.and we have em check it.And a lot of times the pain has decreased. Right it may go down to as much as one or two.or they say oh thats clearly better.Then you know youre on the right track," Bob and Brad   the two most famous   physical therapists   on the internet  Hi folks.I'm Bob Shrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.And we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion, of course, Bob.Brad, today I wanted to talk about patellofemoral pain.and chondromalacia.Got some great self-help techniques and treatments.and exercises you can do for this problem.Techniques, having a hard time pronouncing that one.Did I say that weird?.No, no, you're doing fine.What are you smiling about?.(laughing).All right, this is Napoleon Bone Apart.Isn't that funny, Brad?.Ha ha ha.= All right, so today we're gonna show you generally.with patellofemoral pain syndrome is what they call it.You're having pain on the front part of the knee here.A lot of times around the kneecap, it often catches.It doesn't usually lock.but you might get this catching sensation.You might also get some grinding.Sure.And hear some popping even.Oftentimes going up and particularly downstairs.Yeah, very good point, Brad.Going on hilly surfaces, worse going down.The stresses on your knee are higher going down.I just saw a study on that.Yeah, I believe it.I believe it, Bob.So what you're gonna wanna do is also.what we call the movie goer sign, by the way, Brad.Oh, yes.If you're watching a movie and your knees are bent.like this, you know, for a long period of time.you start having increased pain with that.Yeah, so quit watching movies.Just kidding.One test that we do, Brad, by the way,.is called Clark's sign.or I think it's patella grinding test.Sure.Do you wanna just roll up your pant leg, Brad?.Oh, do I ever Bob.So let's go ahead and get this stool over here, this.I would do this.He would be laying flat on the bed.Okay.But what I do is I usually tell him.to first, go ahead and tighten the knee.or push the knee down into the bed.Yep, like that.And I tell him to do it very slow.Okay, and then I go ahead and I put my hand right here.Yep.Relax first.Okay.And then I go ahead and now tighten the knee.So now I'm pulling, my knee cap is gonna go.up towards my stomach.And if that's positive, it is gonna be painful.Okay.All right, now that's painful in some people.Is it painful on you?.No, but it feels a little weird.Yeah.But it I was like maybe it's gonna hurt,.but it really didn't.The correlation is a little questionable sometimes.but it's, to me, it's at least one of the signs.that you have.Sure, mm-hmm.The other signs is what.Later I'm gonna show you how to tape it.If the taping feels better,.To me, that's often a good sign.that it's patellofemoral syndrome.Right But you're gonna show that later.Yeah.Okay Bob, there's one more thing.We got some new people out there.that maybe haven't heard of our show before.Yeah, if you've never watched one of our channel-.watched our channel before,.even if you have, please take a second to subscribe.We got a subscribe button here.over here on the left hand side, left of Brad.And we provide videos on stay healthy, fit, pain free.and we upload every day.Say no more Bob, back to the knee.So what's happening with patellofemoral syndrome.or chondromalacia.is that.you got the kneecap here.and it normally.let's go on this side.I took the kneecap off on this side.You see this little canal here?.The kneecap doesn't just stay static.It actually is moving up and down.in this little canal here.Is that called the femoral groove?.Yep.Mm-hmm.So as we're going, it's moving up and along.in the femoral groove here.and what happens with patellofemoral syndrome quite often.is that it gets a little bit off track.It's not lining like it should.It's not lined up there.It's not lined up like it should.And you can see these are sharp edges here, Brad.Oh yeah.So if you, if the patella.which is a little bit soft underneath it,.as it gets over on the side here.it can actually wear out the underside of the patella.And that's the chondromalacia part of it.Sure.I mean, softening of the kneecap.Right.So what we wanna do is get it back.into the groove here and have it stay there.so it can calm down and not give you so much pain.or give you that grinding or that catching.Right You know that that's a joint actually cartilage.and you want the large surfaces rubbing against each other.as opposed to that edge Bob was talking about.Now, they used to think, Brad,.that if your knee was a little bit bent like this,.that Q angle, like on women, that that causes this.but now they finding out that's really not the case.Okay.But they are finding out.that you, if you have flat feet.that that does tend to contribute to it.So if you have flat feet.when you put weight, it changes the mechanics.so that you're more predisposed to that.Yeah It's not tracking right.Also they don't like the hip to be internally rotated.Like when you're doing sports.you don't want your leg in like this.that can predispose you to causing the knee pain.Sure.And not traveling the way it should.All right, let's talk about the first treatments.we're gonna do here, Brad.So the first thing we're gonna do.is you're just gonna go ahead and make sure you're icing.I mean, you know.Cold pack.Just get the ice pack, cold pack.after you've been doing sports.Let's try to get it to calm down.And typically you're gonna do that with a straight knee.You're not gonna have it bent, I'm assuming,.so that there's less stress on it if there at all.Well, or maybe in the loose pack position.Sure.Maybe slight flexion with,.I'd go ahead and do it in that way.The next thing I wanna do is I want you to go ahead.and start stretching that, the patella.Okay.So you're actually gonna go ahead and here's your kneecap,.and you're gonna actually, Brad,.you can do it on yours and I can do it on mine,.but you're gonna go ahead and it's gotta be relaxed.You're usually laying flat.and you're gonna go ahead and you're gonna push the patella.So here's the kneecap.I'm gonna push it down.I'm gonna push it up.And I'm also gonna push it towards the other knee.Yep.Towards the in central medial.So you gotta be relaxed to do this,.but you you see I'm pushing down.You're gonna feel it.You wanna feel the kneecap actually move.and then you're gonna also push up.Yeah, I'll see if they can get a different view this way.It's kind of hard 'cause my skid's moving all over.But you know, when I was a PT student, I had no idea.that the kneecap moved this much.Yeah.If you, if your quads are completely relaxed,.it really, you can really.move your kneecap around quite a bit.Well, and that's the problem.is some of you who have this.may not be able to move your kneecap very much.It may be very tight.These structures, you know, the quad may be tight.The patella tendon may be tight.The IT band, as it comes in here, may be all tight.Sure.The lateral structures.So that's what you're starting to do.is you're starting to do these stretches.and you can do this.I have a girl right now who's doing this.and she's in class and she's doing this while she's-.Sure.She's listening to her teacher.So you told her if you're getting bored with class.Yeah.Mobilize your kneecap.I actually you her do some straight leg raises.'cause we're gonna have her do some strengthening too.Now the probably the most standard treatment.that therapists do now for patellofemoral syndrome.is the McConnell taping.Sure.So Brad, do you wanna stay?.Yes I do.So what we're doing with this.is very simply we're gonna take the kneecap.and now I know all the therapists.that peer us out there are gonna be screaming at me here,.while the kneecap could be tilted, it could be rotated.But I have found out that with most people,.if they just try and push the kneecap over.and tape it over towards the other kneecap.Mm-hmm.And see if it feels better.Why not just try that first?.Try the simple, the simple remedy first.And this is for, for people at home.this is what all you really can do.And if it works, it works.If it doesn't work, no harm.Take it off, yeah.No harm done.Just a cost of a little bit of tape.Right.And why not give it a try?.So Brad, normally what we do is, and sometimes, you know.like if you get a McConnell taping technique.there's actually material.or that wipes they can do beforehand.Pre wipe, yep.Because the skin can get very irritated.with this taping.Sure.Some people are more predisposed.That was the other

was a five out of 10.Sure.And then we put the tape on,.we have 'em go up and down the stairs.and we have 'em check it.And a lot of times the pain has decreased.Right, it may go down to as much as one or two.or they say, oh, that's clearly better.Then you know, you're on the right track.All right, other things you can do, if you have flat feet.you may want to get arch support.'cause that might help a bit.Sure.But let's go into some.of the strengthening exercises, Brad.One of the first ones I'm gonna have people do,.I'm gonna go, is just go ahead.and good old, straight leg raises.So you can go ahead and I'm strengthening this one here.I'm just gonna go ahead and lift up like this.and I'm go ahead and.we're getting some strengthening of the quad.Right.Lot of times on this.it's more comfortable lay down flat.Sure, you can lay down flat.But Bob's head will fall off the back of the table.The latest research is they want,.you wanna strengthen the knee extensors.Mm-hmm.The hip abductors.So I'm gonna lay on my side and I'm gonna just bend this leg.and I'm gonna work on doing these.which you can do with weight.or you can do without weight.So we're working these muscles up here.And the hip external rotators.So I'm gonna do clamshells.I'm putting my knees together like this.and I'm going like this.There you go.So why don't you turn this way?.So they can see it from both directions.You're gonna.Well it's gonna be the wrong leg.and it's gonna be by mic, but.So yeah, here's hip abductors.and here's clamshells, hip external rotators.And normally, he can't.because he's gonna go on his mic box there.but you lay down flat with a pillow and be comfortable.So the eventual thing too, Brad.is I usually try to teach people how to hop eventually.And, and that is, you know, when they're,.when they're standing, like they don't wanna hop.and land like this.Right.They wanna learn to land correctly.like this once the knee pain has gone away.Right.So the knees don't jet in towards each other.You go to the side and back,.forward and back,.keeping the knees, you know,.the knees are not going past the feet.They're, they're staying in that good athletic position.So those are some of the things to keep in mind.And when you go back to athletics, remember, you know.you're gonna start off gradually.Run on flat surfaces, not hills.Avoid the steps and all that,

9s3geiwg1AA,How to treat patellofemoral pain by performing straight leg raises?,"(594, 615)", But lets go into some.of the strengthening exercises Brad.One of the first ones Im gonna have people do.Im gonna go is just go ahead.and good old straight leg raises.So you can go ahead and Im strengthening this one here.Im just gonna go ahead and lift up like this.and Im go ahead and.were getting some strengthening of the quad. Right.Lot of times on this.its more comfortable lay down flat. Sure you can lay down flat. But Bobs head will fall off the back of the table," Bob and Brad   the two most famous   physical therapists   on the internet  Hi folks.I'm Bob Shrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.And we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion, of course, Bob.Brad, today I wanted to talk about patellofemoral pain.and chondromalacia.Got some great self-help techniques and treatments.and exercises you can do for this problem.Techniques, having a hard time pronouncing that one.Did I say that weird?.No, no, you're doing fine.What are you smiling about?.(laughing).All right, this is Napoleon Bone Apart.Isn't that funny, Brad?.Ha ha ha.= All right, so today we're gonna show you generally.with patellofemoral pain syndrome is what they call it.You're having pain on the front part of the knee here.A lot of times around the kneecap, it often catches.It doesn't usually lock.but you might get this catching sensation.You might also get some grinding.Sure.And hear some popping even.Oftentimes going up and particularly downstairs.Yeah, very good point, Brad.Going on hilly surfaces, worse going down.The stresses on your knee are higher going down.I just saw a study on that.Yeah, I believe it.I believe it, Bob.So what you're gonna wanna do is also.what we call the movie goer sign, by the way, Brad.Oh, yes.If you're watching a movie and your knees are bent.like this, you know, for a long period of time.you start having increased pain with that.Yeah, so quit watching movies.Just kidding.One test that we do, Brad, by the way,.is called Clark's sign.or I think it's patella grinding test.Sure.Do you wanna just roll up your pant leg, Brad?.Oh, do I ever Bob.So let's go ahead and get this stool over here, this.I would do this.He would be laying flat on the bed.Okay.But what I do is I usually tell him.to first, go ahead and tighten the knee.or push the knee down into the bed.Yep, like that.And I tell him to do it very slow.Okay, and then I go ahead and I put my hand right here.Yep.Relax first.Okay.And then I go ahead and now tighten the knee.So now I'm pulling, my knee cap is gonna go.up towards my stomach.And if that's positive, it is gonna be painful.Okay.All right, now that's painful in some people.Is it painful on you?.No, but it feels a little weird.Yeah.But it I was like maybe it's gonna hurt,.but it really didn't.The correlation is a little questionable sometimes.but it's, to me, it's at least one of the signs.that you have.Sure, mm-hmm.The other signs is what.Later I'm gonna show you how to tape it.If the taping feels better,.To me, that's often a good sign.that it's patellofemoral syndrome.Right But you're gonna show that later.Yeah.Okay Bob, there's one more thing.We got some new people out there.that maybe haven't heard of our show before.Yeah, if you've never watched one of our channel-.watched our channel before,.even if you have, please take a second to subscribe.We got a subscribe button here.over here on the left hand side, left of Brad.And we provide videos on stay healthy, fit, pain free.and we upload every day.Say no more Bob, back to the knee.So what's happening with patellofemoral syndrome.or chondromalacia.is that.you got the kneecap here.and it normally.let's go on this side.I took the kneecap off on this side.You see this little canal here?.The kneecap doesn't just stay static.It actually is moving up and down.in this little canal here.Is that called the femoral groove?.Yep.Mm-hmm.So as we're going, it's moving up and along.in the femoral groove here.and what happens with patellofemoral syndrome quite often.is that it gets a little bit off track.It's not lining like it should.It's not lined up there.It's not lined up like it should.And you can see these are sharp edges here, Brad.Oh yeah.So if you, if the patella.which is a little bit soft underneath it,.as it gets over on the side here.it can actually wear out the underside of the patella.And that's the chondromalacia part of it.Sure.I mean, softening of the kneecap.Right.So what we wanna do is get it back.into the groove here and have it stay there.so it can calm down and not give you so much pain.or give you that grinding or that catching.Right You know that that's a joint actually cartilage.and you want the large surfaces rubbing against each other.as opposed to that edge Bob was talking about.Now, they used to think, Brad,.that if your knee was a little bit bent like this,.that Q angle, like on women, that that causes this.but now they finding out that's really not the case.Okay.But they are finding out.that you, if you have flat feet.that that does tend to contribute to it.So if you have flat feet.when you put weight, it changes the mechanics.so that you're more predisposed to that.Yeah It's not tracking right.Also they don't like the hip to be internally rotated.Like when you're doing sports.you don't want your leg in like this.that can predispose you to causing the knee pain.Sure.And not traveling the way it should.All right, let's talk about the first treatments.we're gonna do here, Brad.So the first thing we're gonna do.is you're just gonna go ahead and make sure you're icing.I mean, you know.Cold pack.Just get the ice pack, cold pack.after you've been doing sports.Let's try to get it to calm down.And typically you're gonna do that with a straight knee.You're not gonna have it bent, I'm assuming,.so that there's less stress on it if there at all.Well, or maybe in the loose pack position.Sure.Maybe slight flexion with,.I'd go ahead and do it in that way.The next thing I wanna do is I want you to go ahead.and start stretching that, the patella.Okay.So you're actually gonna go ahead and here's your kneecap,.and you're gonna actually, Brad,.you can do it on yours and I can do it on mine,.but you're gonna go ahead and it's gotta be relaxed.You're usually laying flat.and you're gonna go ahead and you're gonna push the patella.So here's the kneecap.I'm gonna push it down.I'm gonna push it up.And I'm also gonna push it towards the other knee.Yep.Towards the in central medial.So you gotta be relaxed to do this,.but you you see I'm pushing down.You're gonna feel it.You wanna feel the kneecap actually move.and then you're gonna also push up.Yeah, I'll see if they can get a different view this way.It's kind of hard 'cause my skid's moving all over.But you know, when I was a PT student, I had no idea.that the kneecap moved this much.Yeah.If you, if your quads are completely relaxed,.it really, you can really.move your kneecap around quite a bit.Well, and that's the problem.is some of you who have this.may not be able to move your kneecap very much.It may be very tight.These structures, you know, the quad may be tight.The patella tendon may be tight.The IT band, as it comes in here, may be all tight.Sure.The lateral structures.So that's what you're starting to do.is you're starting to do these stretches.and you can do this.I have a girl right now who's doing this.and she's in class and she's doing this while she's-.Sure.She's listening to her teacher.So you told her if you're getting bored with class.Yeah.Mobilize your kneecap.I actually you her do some straight leg raises.'cause we're gonna have her do some strengthening too.Now the probably the most standard treatment.that therapists do now for patellofemoral syndrome.is the McConnell taping.Sure.So Brad, do you wanna stay?.Yes I do.So what we're doing with this.is very simply we're gonna take the kneecap.and now I know all the therapists.that peer us out there are gonna be screaming at me here,.while the kneecap could be tilted, it could be rotated.But I have found out that with most people,.if they just try and push the kneecap over.and tape it over towards the other kneecap.Mm-hmm.And see if it feels better.Why not just try that first?.Try the simple, the simple remedy first.And this is for, for people at home.this is what all you really can do.And if it works, it works.If it doesn't work, no harm.Take it off, yeah.No harm done.Just a cost of a little bit of tape.Right.And why not give it a try?.So Brad, normally what we do is, and sometimes, you know.like if you get a McConnell taping technique.there's actually material.or that wipes they can do beforehand.Pre wipe, yep.Because the skin can get very irritated.with this taping.Sure.Some people are more predisposed.That was the other thing.This girl I had, she was keeping her tape on for a week.and a trainer had told her to do this.Sure.Oh my God, I took it off.It was red.The skin had started to break down.Yeah.So nobody can keep tape on for a week.They all really recommend 24 hours.I've seen some go 48, but.Mm-hmm.If you're allergic to it,.you're probably gonna start turning red.within a few hours.So if that happens,.get the tape off right away.And this is not an option for you.Even if you're not allergic to it,.you can build up kind of the allergy to it over, I mean.Right.A reaction to it over time.because I've seen people that I've taped for weeks.And then by the fifth week it starts getting irritated.Yeah.And usually you hope you don't have to go that long.Right.So I put an underlying underlayment tape down first.This is hypoallergenic.and I'm not really doing anything with that.Mm-hmm.But the other piece of tape, what I'm doing is-.Sometimes I'll pull that a little bit.I, I sometimes will.I usually do.Now sometimes if, if you got, you know,.someone with hairy legs,.you might wanna shave.but I'm, I'm not gonna shave my legs.Yeah, he does that on his own personal time.(laughing).So what I do here now is I usually push the kneecap over.So I'm pushing it over towards the other knee.That's usually the direction you wanna try.and I'll put the tape right on the edge of the kneecap.Sure.And I'll push it over and while I'm pushing it over.I'll pull on the tape at the same time.Yep.And you actually might get a little wrinkled.up in there in the skin and that's fine.Yep.And I usually like to do a double one, Brad.Okay.I'll sometimes make mine a little bit longer.just so it has more sticky and it has less apt to wrinkles.I agree, I agree.It should go around here.And then sometimes I'll put some tape.over the top of it to stop the edges from catching.Yeah.But again, I push over, I'm on the edge of the kneecap.I'm pushing pretty good on it, Brad.Yep.And then I pull and wrap it and the test,.you know this is a good test.A lot of times, Brad, what we'll do.Brad and I both will have somebody walk upstairs.without the tape on.And they'll say, how bad was the pain?.They'll say maybe it was a five out of 10.Sure.And then we put the tape on,.we have 'em go up and down the stairs.and we have 'em check it.And a lot of times the pain has decreased.Right, it may go down to as much as one or two.or they say, oh, that's clearly better.Then you know, you're on the right track.All right, other things you can do, if you have flat feet.you may want to get arch support.'cause that might help a bit.Sure.But let's go into some.of the strengthening exercises, Brad.One of the first ones I'm gonna have people do,.I'm gonna go, is just go ahead.and good old, straight leg raises.So you can go ahead and I'm strengthening this one here.I'm just gonna go ahead and lift up like this.and I'm go ahead and.we're getting some strengthening of the quad.Right.Lot of times on this.it's more comfortable lay down flat.Sure, you can lay down flat.But Bob's head will fall off the back of the table.The latest research is they want,.you wanna strengthen the knee extensors.Mm-hmm.The hip abductors.So I'm gonna lay on my side and I'm gonna just bend this leg.and I'm gonna work on doing these.which you can do with weight.or you can do without weight.So we're working these muscles up here.And the hip external rotators.So I'm gonna do clamshells.I'm putting my knees together like this.and I'm going like this.There you go.So why don't you turn this way?.So they can see it from both directions.You're gonna.Well it's gonna be the wrong leg.and it's gonna be by mic, but.So yeah, here's hip abductors.and here's clamshells, hip external rotators.And normally, he can't.because he's gonna go on his mic box there.but you lay down flat with a pillow and be comfortable.So the eventual thing too, Brad.is I usually try to teach people how to hop eventually.And, and that is, you know, when they're,.when they're standing, like they don't wanna hop.and land like this.Right.They wanna learn to land correctly.like this once the knee pain has gone away.Right.So the knees don't jet in towards each other.You go to the side and back,.forward and back,.keeping the knees, you know,.the knees are not going past the feet.They're, they're staying in that good athletic position.So those are some of the things to keep in mind.And when you go back to athletics, remember, you know.you're gonna start off gradually.Run on flat surfaces, not hills.Avoid the steps and all that, so.Right.Thanks for watching, folks.Good job, Bob.Thanks.Here's a nice kneecap right here Look at this","{'(155.634,

9s3geiwg1AA,How to treat patellofemoral pain by performing straight side leg raises?,"(615, 632)", But Bobs head will fall off the back of the table. The latest research is they want.you wanna strengthen the knee extensors. Mmhmm. The hip abductors.So Im gonna lay on my side and Im gonna just bend this leg.and Im gonna work on doing these.which you can do with weight.or you can do without weight. So were working these muscles up here," Bob and Brad   the two most famous   physical therapists   on the internet  Hi folks.I'm Bob Shrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.And we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion, of course, Bob.Brad, today I wanted to talk about patellofemoral pain.and chondromalacia.Got some great self-help techniques and treatments.and exercises you can do for this problem.Techniques, having a hard time pronouncing that one.Did I say that weird?.No, no, you're doing fine.What are you smiling about?.(laughing).All right, this is Napoleon Bone Apart.Isn't that funny, Brad?.Ha ha ha.= All right, so today we're gonna show you generally.with patellofemoral pain syndrome is what they call it.You're having pain on the front part of the knee here.A lot of times around the kneecap, it often catches.It doesn't usually lock.but you might get this catching sensation.You might also get some grinding.Sure.And hear some popping even.Oftentimes going up and particularly downstairs.Yeah, very good point, Brad.Going on hilly surfaces, worse going down.The stresses on your knee are higher going down.I just saw a study on that.Yeah, I believe it.I believe it, Bob.So what you're gonna wanna do is also.what we call the movie goer sign, by the way, Brad.Oh, yes.If you're watching a movie and your knees are bent.like this, you know, for a long period of time.you start having increased pain with that.Yeah, so quit watching movies.Just kidding.One test that we do, Brad, by the way,.is called Clark's sign.or I think it's patella grinding test.Sure.Do you wanna just roll up your pant leg, Brad?.Oh, do I ever Bob.So let's go ahead and get this stool over here, this.I would do this.He would be laying flat on the bed.Okay.But what I do is I usually tell him.to first, go ahead and tighten the knee.or push the knee down into the bed.Yep, like that.And I tell him to do it very slow.Okay, and then I go ahead and I put my hand right here.Yep.Relax first.Okay.And then I go ahead and now tighten the knee.So now I'm pulling, my knee cap is gonna go.up towards my stomach.And if that's positive, it is gonna be painful.Okay.All right, now that's painful in some people.Is it painful on you?.No, but it feels a little weird.Yeah.But it I was like maybe it's gonna hurt,.but it really didn't.The correlation is a little questionable sometimes.but it's, to me, it's at least one of the signs.that you have.Sure, mm-hmm.The other signs is what.Later I'm gonna show you how to tape it.If the taping feels better,.To me, that's often a good sign.that it's patellofemoral syndrome.Right But you're gonna show that later.Yeah.Okay Bob, there's one more thing.We got some new people out there.that maybe haven't heard of our show before.Yeah, if you've never watched one of our channel-.watched our channel before,.even if you have, please take a second to subscribe.We got a subscribe button here.over here on the left hand side, left of Brad.And we provide videos on stay healthy, fit, pain free.and we upload every day.Say no more Bob, back to the knee.So what's happening with patellofemoral syndrome.or chondromalacia.is that.you got the kneecap here.and it normally.let's go on this side.I took the kneecap off on this side.You see this little canal here?.The kneecap doesn't just stay static.It actually is moving up and down.in this little canal here.Is that called the femoral groove?.Yep.Mm-hmm.So as we're going, it's moving up and along.in the femoral groove here.and what happens with patellofemoral syndrome quite often.is that it gets a little bit off track.It's not lining like it should.It's not lined up there.It's not lined up like it should.And you can see these are sharp edges here, Brad.Oh yeah.So if you, if the patella.which is a little bit soft underneath it,.as it gets over on the side here.it can actually wear out the underside of the patella.And that's the chondromalacia part of it.Sure.I mean, softening of the kneecap.Right.So what we wanna do is get it back.into the groove here and have it stay there.so it can calm down and not give you so much pain.or give you that grinding or that catching.Right You know that that's a joint actually cartilage.and you want the large surfaces rubbing against each other.as opposed to that edge Bob was talking about.Now, they used to think, Brad,.that if your knee was a little bit bent like this,.that Q angle, like on women, that that causes this.but now they finding out that's really not the case.Okay.But they are finding out.that you, if you have flat feet.that that does tend to contribute to it.So if you have flat feet.when you put weight, it changes the mechanics.so that you're more predisposed to that.Yeah It's not tracking right.Also they don't like the hip to be internally rotated.Like when you're doing sports.you don't want your leg in like this.that can predispose you to causing the knee pain.Sure.And not traveling the way it should.All right, let's talk about the first treatments.we're gonna do here, Brad.So the first thing we're gonna do.is you're just gonna go ahead and make sure you're icing.I mean, you know.Cold pack.Just get the ice pack, cold pack.after you've been doing sports.Let's try to get it to calm down.And typically you're gonna do that with a straight knee.You're not gonna have it bent, I'm assuming,.so that there's less stress on it if there at all.Well, or maybe in the loose pack position.Sure.Maybe slight flexion with,.I'd go ahead and do it in that way.The next thing I wanna do is I want you to go ahead.and start stretching that, the patella.Okay.So you're actually gonna go ahead and here's your kneecap,.and you're gonna actually, Brad,.you can do it on yours and I can do it on mine,.but you're gonna go ahead and it's gotta be relaxed.You're usually laying flat.and you're gonna go ahead and you're gonna push the patella.So here's the kneecap.I'm gonna push it down.I'm gonna push it up.And I'm also gonna push it towards the other knee.Yep.Towards the in central medial.So you gotta be relaxed to do this,.but you you see I'm pushing down.You're gonna feel it.You wanna feel the kneecap actually move.and then you're gonna also push up.Yeah, I'll see if they can get a different view this way.It's kind of hard 'cause my skid's moving all over.But you know, when I was a PT student, I had no idea.that the kneecap moved this much.Yeah.If you, if your quads are completely relaxed,.it really, you can really.move your kneecap around quite a bit.Well, and that's the problem.is some of you who have this.may not be able to move your kneecap very much.It may be very tight.These structures, you know, the quad may be tight.The patella tendon may be tight.The IT band, as it comes in here, may be all tight.Sure.The lateral structures.So that's what you're starting to do.is you're starting to do these stretches.and you can do this.I have a girl right now who's doing this.and she's in class and she's doing this while she's-.Sure.She's listening to her teacher.So you told her if you're getting bored with class.Yeah.Mobilize your kneecap.I actually you her do some straight leg raises.'cause we're gonna have her do some strengthening too.Now the probably the most standard treatment.that therapists do now for patellofemoral syndrome.is the McConnell taping.Sure.So Brad, do you wanna stay?.Yes I do.So what we're doing with this.is very simply we're gonna take the kneecap.and now I know all the therapists.that peer us out there are gonna be screaming at me here,.while the kneecap could be tilted, it could be rotated.But I have found out that with most people,.if they just try and push the kneecap over.and tape it over towards the other kneecap.Mm-hmm.And see if it feels better.Why not just try that first?.Try the simple, the simple remedy first.And this is for, for people at home.this is what all you really can do.And if it works, it works.If it doesn't work, no harm.Take it off, yeah.No harm done.Just a cost of a little bit of tape.Right.And why not give it a try?.So Brad, normally what we do is, and sometimes, you know.like if you get a McConnell taping technique.there's actually material.or that wipes they can do beforehand.Pre wipe, yep.Because the skin can get very irritated.with this taping.Sure.Some people are more predisposed.That was the other thing.This girl I had, she was keeping her tape on for a week.and a trainer had told her to do this.Sure.Oh my God, I took it off.It was red.The skin had started to break down.Yeah.So nobody can keep tape on for a week.They all really recommend 24 hours.I've seen some go 48, but.Mm-hmm.If you're allergic to it,.you're probably gonna start turning red.within a few hours.So if that happens,.get the tape off right away.And this is not an option for you.Even if you're not allergic to it,.you can build up kind of the allergy to it over, I mean.Right.A reaction to it over time.because I've seen people that I've taped for weeks.And then by the fifth week it starts getting irritated.Yeah.And usually you hope you don't have to go that long.Right.So I put an underlying underlayment tape down first.This is hypoallergenic.and I'm not really doing anything with that.Mm-hmm.But the other piece of tape, what I'm doing is-.Sometimes I'll pull that a little bit.I, I sometimes will.I usually do.Now sometimes if, if you got, you know,.someone with hairy legs,.you might wanna shave.but I'm, I'm not gonna shave my legs.Yeah, he does that on his own personal time.(laughing).So what I do here now is I usually push the kneecap over.So I'm pushing it over towards the other knee.That's usually the direction you wanna try.and I'll put the tape right on the edge of the kneecap.Sure.And I'll push it over and while I'm pushing it over.I'll pull on the tape at the same time.Yep.And you actually might get a little wrinkled.up in there in the skin and that's fine.Yep.And I usually like to do a double one, Brad.Okay.I'll sometimes make mine a little bit longer.just so it has more sticky and it has less apt to wrinkles.I agree, I agree.It should go around here.And then sometimes I'll put some tape.over the top of it to stop the edges from catching.Yeah.But again, I push over, I'm on the edge of the kneecap.I'm pushing pretty good on it, Brad.Yep.And then I pull and wrap it and the test,.you know this is a good test.A lot of times, Brad, what we'll do.Brad and I both will have somebody walk upstairs.without the tape on.And they'll say, how bad was the pain?.They'll say maybe it was a five out of 10.Sure.And then we put the tape on,.we have 'em go up and down the stairs.and we have 'em check it.And a lot of times the pain has decreased.Right, it may go down to as much as one or two.or they say, oh, that's clearly better.Then you know, you're on the right track.All right, other things you can do, if you have flat feet.you may want to get arch support.'cause that might help a bit.Sure.But let's go into some.of the strengthening exercises, Brad.One of the first ones I'm gonna have people do,.I'm gonna go, is just go ahead.and good old, straight leg raises.So you can go ahead and I'm strengthening this one here.I'm just gonna go ahead and lift up like this.and I'm go ahead and.we're getting some strengthening of the quad.Right.Lot of times on this.it's more comfortable lay down flat.Sure, you can lay down flat.But Bob's head will fall off the back of the table.The latest research is they want,.you wanna strengthen the knee extensors.Mm-hmm.The hip abductors.So I'm gonna lay on my side and I'm gonna just bend this leg.and I'm gonna work on doing these.which you can do with weight.or you can do without weight.So we're working these muscles up here.And the hip external rotators.So I'm gonna do clamshells.I'm putting my knees together like this.and I'm going like this.There you go.So why don't you turn this way?.So they can see it from both directions.You're gonna.Well it's gonna be the wrong leg.and it's gonna be by mic, but.So yeah, here's hip abductors.and here's clamshells, hip external rotators.And normally, he can't.because he's gonna go on his mic box there.but you lay down flat with a pillow and be comfortable.So the eventual thing too, Brad.is I usually try to teach people how to hop eventually.And, and that is, you know, when they're,.when they're standing, like they don't wanna hop.and land like this.Right.They wanna learn to land correctly.like this once the knee pain has gone away.Right.So the knees don't jet in towards each other.You go to the side and back,.forward and back,.keeping the knees, you know,.the knees are not going past the feet.They're, they're staying in that good athletic position.So those are some of the things to keep in mind.And when you go back to athletics, remember, you know.you're gonna start off gradually.Run on flat surfaces, not hills.Avoid the steps and all that, so.Right.Thanks for watching, folks.Good job, Bob.Thanks.Here's a nice kneecap right here Look at this","{'(155.634, 156.46699999999998)':

9s3geiwg1AA,How to treat patellofemoral pain by performing clamshells?,"(632, 661)", So were working these muscles up here. And the hip external rotators.So Im gonna do clamshells.Im putting my knees together like this.and Im going like this. There you go.So why dont you turn this way.So they can see it from both directions.Youre gonna. Well its gonna be the wrong leg.and its gonna be by mic but.So yeah heres hip abductors.and heres clamshells hip external rotators. And normally he cant.because hes gonna go on his mic box there.but you lay down flat with a pillow and be comfortable," Bob and Brad   the two most famous   physical therapists   on the internet  Hi folks.I'm Bob Shrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.And we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion, of course, Bob.Brad, today I wanted to talk about patellofemoral pain.and chondromalacia.Got some great self-help techniques and treatments.and exercises you can do for this problem.Techniques, having a hard time pronouncing that one.Did I say that weird?.No, no, you're doing fine.What are you smiling about?.(laughing).All right, this is Napoleon Bone Apart.Isn't that funny, Brad?.Ha ha ha.= All right, so today we're gonna show you generally.with patellofemoral pain syndrome is what they call it.You're having pain on the front part of the knee here.A lot of times around the kneecap, it often catches.It doesn't usually lock.but you might get this catching sensation.You might also get some grinding.Sure.And hear some popping even.Oftentimes going up and particularly downstairs.Yeah, very good point, Brad.Going on hilly surfaces, worse going down.The stresses on your knee are higher going down.I just saw a study on that.Yeah, I believe it.I believe it, Bob.So what you're gonna wanna do is also.what we call the movie goer sign, by the way, Brad.Oh, yes.If you're watching a movie and your knees are bent.like this, you know, for a long period of time.you start having increased pain with that.Yeah, so quit watching movies.Just kidding.One test that we do, Brad, by the way,.is called Clark's sign.or I think it's patella grinding test.Sure.Do you wanna just roll up your pant leg, Brad?.Oh, do I ever Bob.So let's go ahead and get this stool over here, this.I would do this.He would be laying flat on the bed.Okay.But what I do is I usually tell him.to first, go ahead and tighten the knee.or push the knee down into the bed.Yep, like that.And I tell him to do it very slow.Okay, and then I go ahead and I put my hand right here.Yep.Relax first.Okay.And then I go ahead and now tighten the knee.So now I'm pulling, my knee cap is gonna go.up towards my stomach.And if that's positive, it is gonna be painful.Okay.All right, now that's painful in some people.Is it painful on you?.No, but it feels a little weird.Yeah.But it I was like maybe it's gonna hurt,.but it really didn't.The correlation is a little questionable sometimes.but it's, to me, it's at least one of the signs.that you have.Sure, mm-hmm.The other signs is what.Later I'm gonna show you how to tape it.If the taping feels better,.To me, that's often a good sign.that it's patellofemoral syndrome.Right But you're gonna show that later.Yeah.Okay Bob, there's one more thing.We got some new people out there.that maybe haven't heard of our show before.Yeah, if you've never watched one of our channel-.watched our channel before,.even if you have, please take a second to subscribe.We got a subscribe button here.over here on the left hand side, left of Brad.And we provide videos on stay healthy, fit, pain free.and we upload every day.Say no more Bob, back to the knee.So what's happening with patellofemoral syndrome.or chondromalacia.is that.you got the kneecap here.and it normally.let's go on this side.I took the kneecap off on this side.You see this little canal here?.The kneecap doesn't just stay static.It actually is moving up and down.in this little canal here.Is that called the femoral groove?.Yep.Mm-hmm.So as we're going, it's moving up and along.in the femoral groove here.and what happens with patellofemoral syndrome quite often.is that it gets a little bit off track.It's not lining like it should.It's not lined up there.It's not lined up like it should.And you can see these are sharp edges here, Brad.Oh yeah.So if you, if the patella.which is a little bit soft underneath it,.as it gets over on the side here.it can actually wear out the underside of the patella.And that's the chondromalacia part of it.Sure.I mean, softening of the kneecap.Right.So what we wanna do is get it back.into the groove here and have it stay there.so it can calm down and not give you so much pain.or give you that grinding or that catching.Right You know that that's a joint actually cartilage.and you want the large surfaces rubbing against each other.as opposed to that edge Bob was talking about.Now, they used to think, Brad,.that if your knee was a little bit bent like this,.that Q angle, like on women, that that causes this.but now they finding out that's really not the case.Okay.But they are finding out.that you, if you have flat feet.that that does tend to contribute to it.So if you have flat feet.when you put weight, it changes the mechanics.so that you're more predisposed to that.Yeah It's not tracking right.Also they don't like the hip to be internally rotated.Like when you're doing sports.you don't want your leg in like this.that can predispose you to causing the knee pain.Sure.And not traveling the way it should.All right, let's talk about the first treatments.we're gonna do here, Brad.So the first thing we're gonna do.is you're just gonna go ahead and make sure you're icing.I mean, you know.Cold pack.Just get the ice pack, cold pack.after you've been doing sports.Let's try to get it to calm down.And typically you're gonna do that with a straight knee.You're not gonna have it bent, I'm assuming,.so that there's less stress on it if there at all.Well, or maybe in the loose pack position.Sure.Maybe slight flexion with,.I'd go ahead and do it in that way.The next thing I wanna do is I want you to go ahead.and start stretching that, the patella.Okay.So you're actually gonna go ahead and here's your kneecap,.and you're gonna actually, Brad,.you can do it on yours and I can do it on mine,.but you're gonna go ahead and it's gotta be relaxed.You're usually laying flat.and you're gonna go ahead and you're gonna push the patella.So here's the kneecap.I'm gonna push it down.I'm gonna push it up.And I'm also gonna push it towards the other knee.Yep.Towards the in central medial.So you gotta be relaxed to do this,.but you you see I'm pushing down.You're gonna feel it.You wanna feel the kneecap actually move.and then you're gonna also push up.Yeah, I'll see if they can get a different view this way.It's kind of hard 'cause my skid's moving all over.But you know, when I was a PT student, I had no idea.that the kneecap moved this much.Yeah.If you, if your quads are completely relaxed,.it really, you can really.move your kneecap around quite a bit.Well, and that's the problem.is some of you who have this.may not be able to move your kneecap very much.It may be very tight.These structures, you know, the quad may be tight.The patella tendon may be tight.The IT band, as it comes in here, may be all tight.Sure.The lateral structures.So that's what you're starting to do.is you're starting to do these stretches.and you can do this.I have a girl right now who's doing this.and she's in class and she's doing this while she's-.Sure.She's listening to her teacher.So you told her if you're getting bored with class.Yeah.Mobilize your kneecap.I actually you her do some straight leg raises.'cause we're gonna have her do some strengthening too.Now the probably the most standard treatment.that therapists do now for patellofemoral syndrome.is the McConnell taping.Sure.So Brad, do you wanna stay?.Yes I do.So what we're doing with this.is very simply we're gonna take the kneecap.and now I know all the therapists.that peer us out there are gonna be screaming at me here,.while the kneecap could be tilted, it could be rotated.But I have found out that with most people,.if they just try and push the kneecap over.and tape it over towards the other kneecap.Mm-hmm.And see if it feels better.Why not just try that first?.Try the simple, the simple remedy first.And this is for, for people at home.this is what all you really can do.And if it works, it works.If it doesn't work, no harm.Take it off, yeah.No harm done.Just a cost of a little bit of tape.Right.And why not give it a try?.So Brad, normally what we do is, and sometimes, you know.like if you get a McConnell taping technique.there's actually material.or that wipes they can do beforehand.Pre wipe, yep.Because the skin can get very irritated.with this taping.Sure.Some people are more predisposed.That was the other thing.This girl I had, she was keeping her tape on for a week.and a trainer had told her to do this.Sure.Oh my God, I took it off.It was red.The skin had started to break down.Yeah.So nobody can keep tape on for a week.They all really recommend 24 hours.I've seen some go 48, but.Mm-hmm.If you're allergic to it,.you're probably gonna start turning red.within a few hours.So if that happens,.get the tape off right away.And this is not an option for you.Even if you're not allergic to it,.you can build up kind of the allergy to it over, I mean.Right.A reaction to it over time.because I've seen people that I've taped for weeks.And then by the fifth week it starts getting irritated.Yeah.And usually you hope you don't have to go that long.Right.So I put an underlying underlayment tape down first.This is hypoallergenic.and I'm not really doing anything with that.Mm-hmm.But the other piece of tape, what I'm doing is-.Sometimes I'll pull that a little bit.I, I sometimes will.I usually do.Now sometimes if, if you got, you know,.someone with hairy legs,.you might wanna shave.but I'm, I'm not gonna shave my legs.Yeah, he does that on his own personal time.(laughing).So what I do here now is I usually push the kneecap over.So I'm pushing it over towards the other knee.That's usually the direction you wanna try.and I'll put the tape right on the edge of the kneecap.Sure.And I'll push it over and while I'm pushing it over.I'll pull on the tape at the same time.Yep.And you actually might get a little wrinkled.up in there in the skin and that's fine.Yep.And I usually like to do a double one, Brad.Okay.I'll sometimes make mine a little bit longer.just so it has more sticky and it has less apt to wrinkles.I agree, I agree.It should go around here.And then sometimes I'll put some tape.over the top of it to stop the edges from catching.Yeah.But again, I push over, I'm on the edge of the kneecap.I'm pushing pretty good on it, Brad.Yep.And then I pull and wrap it and the test,.you know this is a good test.A lot of times, Brad, what we'll do.Brad and I both will have somebody walk upstairs.without the tape on.And they'll say, how bad was the pain?.They'll say maybe it was a five out of 10.Sure.And then we put the tape on,.we have 'em go up and down the stairs.and we have 'em check it.And a lot of times the pain has decreased.Right, it may go down to as much as one or two.or they say, oh, that's clearly better.Then you know, you're on the right track.All right, other things you can do, if you have flat feet.you may want to get arch support.'cause that might help a bit.Sure.But let's go into some.of the strengthening exercises, Brad.One of the first ones I'm gonna have people do,.I'm gonna go, is just go ahead.and good old, straight leg raises.So you can go ahead and I'm strengthening this one here.I'm just gonna go ahead and lift up like this.and I'm go ahead and.we're getting some strengthening of the quad.Right.Lot of times on this.it's more comfortable lay down flat.Sure, you can lay down flat.But Bob's head will fall off the back of the table.The latest research is they want,.you wanna strengthen the knee extensors.Mm-hmm.The hip abductors.So I'm gonna lay on my side and I'm gonna just bend this leg.and I'm gonna work on doing these.which you can do with weight.or you can do without weight.So we're working these muscles up here.And the hip external rotators.So I'm gonna do clamshells.I'm putting my knees together like this.and I'm going like this.There you go.So why don't you turn this way?.So they can see it from both directions.You're gonna.Well it's gonna be the wrong leg.and it's gonna be by mic, but.So yeah, here's hip abductors.and here's clamshells, hip external rotators.And normally, he can't.because he's gonna go on his mic box there.but you lay down flat with a pillow and be comfortable.So the eventual thing too, Brad.is I usually try to teach people how to hop eventually.And, and that is, you know, when they're,.when they're standing, like they don't wanna hop.and land like this.Right.They wanna learn to land correctly.like this once the knee pain has gone away.Right.So the knees don't jet in towards each other.You go to the side and back,.forward and back,.keeping the knees, you know,.the knees are not going past the feet.They're, they're staying in that good athletic position.So those are some of the things to keep in mind.And when you go back to athletics, remember, you know.you're gonna start off gradually.Run on flat surfaces, not hills.Avoid the steps and all that, so.Right.Thanks for watching, folks.Good job, Bob.Thanks.Here's a nice kneecap right here Look at this","{'(155.634, 156.46699999999998)':  'Right', '(406.767, 408.927)': '(laughing)', '(27.45,

9s3geiwg1AA,How to treat patellofemoral pain by hopping correctly?,"(661, 688)",but you lay down flat with a pillow and be comfortable. So the eventual thing too Brad.is I usually try to teach people how to hop eventually.And and that is you know when theyre.when theyre standing like they dont wanna hop.and land like this. Right. They wanna learn to land correctly.like this once the knee pain has gone away. Right.So the knees dont jet in towards each other. You go to the side and back.forward and back.keeping the knees you know.the knees are not going past the feet.Theyre theyre staying in that good athletic position," Bob and Brad   the two most famous   physical therapists   on the internet  Hi folks.I'm Bob Shrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.And we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion, of course, Bob.Brad, today I wanted to talk about patellofemoral pain.and chondromalacia.Got some great self-help techniques and treatments.and exercises you can do for this problem.Techniques, having a hard time pronouncing that one.Did I say that weird?.No, no, you're doing fine.What are you smiling about?.(laughing).All right, this is Napoleon Bone Apart.Isn't that funny, Brad?.Ha ha ha.= All right, so today we're gonna show you generally.with patellofemoral pain syndrome is what they call it.You're having pain on the front part of the knee here.A lot of times around the kneecap, it often catches.It doesn't usually lock.but you might get this catching sensation.You might also get some grinding.Sure.And hear some popping even.Oftentimes going up and particularly downstairs.Yeah, very good point, Brad.Going on hilly surfaces, worse going down.The stresses on your knee are higher going down.I just saw a study on that.Yeah, I believe it.I believe it, Bob.So what you're gonna wanna do is also.what we call the movie goer sign, by the way, Brad.Oh, yes.If you're watching a movie and your knees are bent.like this, you know, for a long period of time.you start having increased pain with that.Yeah, so quit watching movies.Just kidding.One test that we do, Brad, by the way,.is called Clark's sign.or I think it's patella grinding test.Sure.Do you wanna just roll up your pant leg, Brad?.Oh, do I ever Bob.So let's go ahead and get this stool over here, this.I would do this.He would be laying flat on the bed.Okay.But what I do is I usually tell him.to first, go ahead and tighten the knee.or push the knee down into the bed.Yep, like that.And I tell him to do it very slow.Okay, and then I go ahead and I put my hand right here.Yep.Relax first.Okay.And then I go ahead and now tighten the knee.So now I'm pulling, my knee cap is gonna go.up towards my stomach.And if that's positive, it is gonna be painful.Okay.All right, now that's painful in some people.Is it painful on you?.No, but it feels a little weird.Yeah.But it I was like maybe it's gonna hurt,.but it really didn't.The correlation is a little questionable sometimes.but it's, to me, it's at least one of the signs.that you have.Sure, mm-hmm.The other signs is what.Later I'm gonna show you how to tape it.If the taping feels better,.To me, that's often a good sign.that it's patellofemoral syndrome.Right But you're gonna show that later.Yeah.Okay Bob, there's one more thing.We got some new people out there.that maybe haven't heard of our show before.Yeah, if you've never watched one of our channel-.watched our channel before,.even if you have, please take a second to subscribe.We got a subscribe button here.over here on the left hand side, left of Brad.And we provide videos on stay healthy, fit, pain free.and we upload every day.Say no more Bob, back to the knee.So what's happening with patellofemoral syndrome.or chondromalacia.is that.you got the kneecap here.and it normally.let's go on this side.I took the kneecap off on this side.You see this little canal here?.The kneecap doesn't just stay static.It actually is moving up and down.in this little canal here.Is that called the femoral groove?.Yep.Mm-hmm.So as we're going, it's moving up and along.in the femoral groove here.and what happens with patellofemoral syndrome quite often.is that it gets a little bit off track.It's not lining like it should.It's not lined up there.It's not lined up like it should.And you can see these are sharp edges here, Brad.Oh yeah.So if you, if the patella.which is a little bit soft underneath it,.as it gets over on the side here.it can actually wear out the underside of the patella.And that's the chondromalacia part of it.Sure.I mean, softening of the kneecap.Right.So what we wanna do is get it back.into the groove here and have it stay there.so it can calm down and not give you so much pain.or give you that grinding or that catching.Right You know that that's a joint actually cartilage.and you want the large surfaces rubbing against each other.as opposed to that edge Bob was talking about.Now, they used to think, Brad,.that if your knee was a little bit bent like this,.that Q angle, like on women, that that causes this.but now they finding out that's really not the case.Okay.But they are finding out.that you, if you have flat feet.that that does tend to contribute to it.So if you have flat feet.when you put weight, it changes the mechanics.so that you're more predisposed to that.Yeah It's not tracking right.Also they don't like the hip to be internally rotated.Like when you're doing sports.you don't want your leg in like this.that can predispose you to causing the knee pain.Sure.And not traveling the way it should.All right, let's talk about the first treatments.we're gonna do here, Brad.So the first thing we're gonna do.is you're just gonna go ahead and make sure you're icing.I mean, you know.Cold pack.Just get the ice pack, cold pack.after you've been doing sports.Let's try to get it to calm down.And typically you're gonna do that with a straight knee.You're not gonna have it bent, I'm assuming,.so that there's less stress on it if there at all.Well, or maybe in the loose pack position.Sure.Maybe slight flexion with,.I'd go ahead and do it in that way.The next thing I wanna do is I want you to go ahead.and start stretching that, the patella.Okay.So you're actually gonna go ahead and here's your kneecap,.and you're gonna actually, Brad,.you can do it on yours and I can do it on mine,.but you're gonna go ahead and it's gotta be relaxed.You're usually laying flat.and you're gonna go ahead and you're gonna push the patella.So here's the kneecap.I'm gonna push it down.I'm gonna push it up.And I'm also gonna push it towards the other knee.Yep.Towards the in central medial.So you gotta be relaxed to do this,.but you you see I'm pushing down.You're gonna feel it.You wanna feel the kneecap actually move.and then you're gonna also push up.Yeah, I'll see if they can get a different view this way.It's kind of hard 'cause my skid's moving all over.But you know, when I was a PT student, I had no idea.that the kneecap moved this much.Yeah.If you, if your quads are completely relaxed,.it really, you can really.move your kneecap around quite a bit.Well, and that's the problem.is some of you who have this.may not be able to move your kneecap very much.It may be very tight.These structures, you know, the quad may be tight.The patella tendon may be tight.The IT band, as it comes in here, may be all tight.Sure.The lateral structures.So that's what you're starting to do.is you're starting to do these stretches.and you can do this.I have a girl right now who's doing this.and she's in class and she's doing this while she's-.Sure.She's listening to her teacher.So you told her if you're getting bored with class.Yeah.Mobilize your kneecap.I actually you her do some straight leg raises.'cause we're gonna have her do some strengthening too.Now the probably the most standard treatment.that therapists do now for patellofemoral syndrome.is the McConnell taping.Sure.So Brad, do you wanna stay?.Yes I do.So what we're doing with this.is very simply we're gonna take the kneecap.and now I know all the therapists.that peer us out there are gonna be screaming at me here,.while the kneecap could be tilted, it could be rotated.But I have found out that with most people,.if they just try and push the kneecap over.and tape it over towards the other kneecap.Mm-hmm.And see if it feels better.Why not just try that first?.Try the simple, the simple remedy first.And this is for, for people at home.this is what all you really can do.And if it works, it works.If it doesn't work, no harm.Take it off, yeah.No harm done.Just a cost of a little bit of tape.Right.And why not give it a try?.So Brad, normally what we do is, and sometimes, you know.like if you get a McConnell taping technique.there's actually material.or that wipes they can do beforehand.Pre wipe, yep.Because the skin can get very irritated.with this taping.Sure.Some people are more predisposed.That was the other thing.This girl I had, she was keeping her tape on for a week.and a trainer had told her to do this.Sure.Oh my God, I took it off.It was red.The skin had started to break down.Yeah.So nobody can keep tape on for a week.They all really recommend 24 hours.I've seen some go 48, but.Mm-hmm.If you're allergic to it,.you're probably gonna start turning red.within a few hours.So if that happens,.get the tape off right away.And this is not an option for you.Even if you're not allergic to it,.you can build up kind of the allergy to it over, I mean.Right.A reaction to it over time.because I've seen people that I've taped for weeks.And then by the fifth week it starts getting irritated.Yeah.And usually you hope you don't have to go that long.Right.So I put an underlying underlayment tape down first.This is hypoallergenic.and I'm not really doing anything with that.Mm-hmm.But the other piece of tape, what I'm doing is-.Sometimes I'll pull that a little bit.I, I sometimes will.I usually do.Now sometimes if, if you got, you know,.someone with hairy legs,.you might wanna shave.but I'm, I'm not gonna shave my legs.Yeah, he does that on his own personal time.(laughing).So what I do here now is I usually push the kneecap over.So I'm pushing it over towards the other knee.That's usually the direction you wanna try.and I'll put the tape right on the edge of the kneecap.Sure.And I'll push it over and while I'm pushing it over.I'll pull on the tape at the same time.Yep.And you actually might get a little wrinkled.up in there in the skin and that's fine.Yep.And I usually like to do a double one, Brad.Okay.I'll sometimes make mine a little bit longer.just so it has more sticky and it has less apt to wrinkles.I agree, I agree.It should go around here.And then sometimes I'll put some tape.over the top of it to stop the edges from catching.Yeah.But again, I push over, I'm on the edge of the kneecap.I'm pushing pretty good on it, Brad.Yep.And then I pull and wrap it and the test,.you know this is a good test.A lot of times, Brad, what we'll do.Brad and I both will have somebody walk upstairs.without the tape on.And they'll say, how bad was the pain?.They'll say maybe it was a five out of 10.Sure.And then we put the tape on,.we have 'em go up and down the stairs.and we have 'em check it.And a lot of times the pain has decreased.Right, it may go down to as much as one or two.or they say, oh, that's clearly better.Then you know, you're on the right track.All right, other things you can do, if you have flat feet.you may want to get arch support.'cause that might help a bit.Sure.But let's go into some.of the strengthening exercises, Brad.One of the first ones I'm gonna have people do,.I'm gonna go, is just go ahead.and good old, straight leg raises.So you can go ahead and I'm strengthening this one here.I'm just gonna go ahead and lift up like this.and I'm go ahead and.we're getting some strengthening of the quad.Right.Lot of times on this.it's more comfortable lay down flat.Sure, you can lay down flat.But Bob's head will fall off the back of the table.The latest research is they want,.you wanna strengthen the knee extensors.Mm-hmm.The hip abductors.So I'm gonna lay on my side and I'm gonna just bend this leg.and I'm gonna work on doing these.which you can do with weight.or you can do without weight.So we're working these muscles up here.And the hip external rotators.So I'm gonna do clamshells.I'm putting my knees together like this.and I'm going like this.There you go.So why don't you turn this way?.So they can see it from both directions.You're gonna.Well it's gonna be the wrong leg.and it's gonna be by mic, but.So yeah, here's hip abductors.and here's clamshells, hip external rotators.And normally, he can't.because he's gonna go on his mic box there.but you lay down flat with a pillow and be comfortable.So the eventual thing too, Brad.is I usually try to teach people how to hop eventually.And, and that is, you know, when they're,.when they're standing, like they don't wanna hop.and land like this.Right.They wanna learn to land correctly.like this once the knee pain has gone away.Right.So the knees don't jet in towards each other.You go to the side and back,.forward and back,.keeping the knees, you know,.the knees are not going past the feet.They're, they're staying in that good athletic position.So those are some of the things to keep in mind.And when you go back to athletics, remember, you know.you're gonna start off gradually.Run on flat surfaces, not hills.Avoid the steps and all that, so.Right.Thanks for watching, folks.Good job, Bob.Thanks.Here's a nice kneecap right here Look at this","{'(155.634, 156.46699999999998)':  'Right', '(406.767, 408.927)': '(laughing)', '(27.45,

_bZHLRfVYtU,How to do an upper back opener exercise to self-release your upper back for instant pain relief?,"(50, 159)",the morning or before you go to bed at night Im going to lay.flat on my back just like this Lets take our hands place.them behind our head for a little bit of support What Im.gonna do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head.right off the edge of the bed We want to focus on just.letting gravity take our body weight So its just taking my.head and shoulders and arms downwards like The more that.you go down the more that youre going to feel a stretch.over the area where your upper back is placed over the bed.So you want to go down as far as youre able to go just.letting gravity take it From there what I do is wing my.elbows down just a little bit and then push down with my.head This will create a passive stretch into the upper.back and if it is locked up you may feel it go pop click.or crack Again that is just gases being released from the.joints You want to hold this about five seconds youre just.going to relax take a breather and then youre going to repeat.so just press down a little bit more with this next repetition.to open up the back just a little bit more but you can do.this for about three to 5 repetitions from there I just.slide down a little bit and then repeat pretty much all the.way from the upper back to the middle back with this one too.the further that you go down the more that youre going to.be able to go downwards like this so only go to your comfort.level if you do find that one particular spot is the spot.that youre having a lot of achiness or pain stop right.over that spot and then at this point what were going to do.is wing the elbows down like this Were going to push down.with the head to create that passive traction and hopefully.this will get it to release If it doesnt you can put a.little bit more passive stretch in there by just quickly.winging the elbows down just a little bit and I dont know if.you heard it over the microphone but I got a very.good release into my upper back right there but this is a good.way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding.up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that.need it the most So here is a great upper back opener that,"This video, I'm going to show you how to self-release your.upper back for instant pain relief Stay tuned.Hey, everyone Dr Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St.Joseph, Michigan If you're dealing with a tight, locked.up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self.release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not.going to want to miss I'm going to go over different.exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back.and give quick relief, even in as little as 30 seconds As a.side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments They.don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments.They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a.satisfying pop, crack, or release So, let's get started.and get the upper back feeling better Right now So, here is.an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in.the morning or before you go to bed at night I'm going to lay.flat on my back just like this Let's take our hands, place.them behind our head for a little bit of support What I'm.gonna do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head.right off the edge of the bed We want to focus on just.letting gravity take our body weight So, it's just taking my.head and shoulders and arms downwards like The more that.you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch.over the area where your upper back is placed over the bed.So, you want to go down as far as you're able to go just.letting gravity take it From there, what I do is wing my.elbows down just a little bit and then push down with my.head This will create a passive stretch into the upper.back and if it is locked up, you may feel it go pop, click,.or crack Again, that is just gases being released from the.joints You want to hold this about five seconds you're just.going to relax take a breather and then you're going to repeat.so just press down a little bit more with this next repetition.to open up the back just a little bit more but you can do.this for about three to 5 repetitions from there I just.slide down a little bit and then repeat pretty much all the.way from the upper back to the middle back with this one too.the further that you go down the more that you're going to.be able to go downwards like this so only go to your comfort.level if you do find that one particular spot is the spot.that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right.over that spot and then at this point, what we're going to do.is wing the elbows down like this We're going to push down.with the head to create that passive traction and hopefully,.this will get it to release If it doesn't, you can put a.little bit more passive stretch in there by just quickly.winging the elbows down just a little bit and I don't know if.you heard it over the microphone but I got a very.good release into my upper back right there but this is a good.way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding.up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that.need it the most So, here is a great upper back opener that.you can do at the edge of a bed You can also use the.armrest of a couch, a desk, or a chair It just needs to be.flat and elevated We're also going to start off on our.knees So, make sure to put a pillow or towel underneath them.for extra comfort Let's go right up to that flat elevated.surface I'm going to bend the arm like this and place the.backside of my arms flat on that elevated surface Let's.press down a little bit too just to create a stable anchor.point My hand they're going to go on my upper back right.across the shoulders just like this From here, I'm going to.tuck my chin towards my chest The movement is very easy I'm.just going to simply lower my body weight Kinda like taking.my butt down towards my heels Also, during this, I'm going to.let my chest go towards the edge of that flat elevated.surface as much as we can The more that you go down, the more.that you're going to feel a good stretch happening into the.upper back that goes all the way down to the middle and.lower back So, it usually feels really and if there is a.segment that's locked up, this will help open it up through.kind of a decompression traction pull but go down as.far as you're able to go Once you feel that comfortable.stretch, let's hold this for 20 seconds Do nice, slow,.controlled breathing also Let that tension out The more you.relax, the more results that you're gonna get with this.From there, I'm just going to relax, come back up, take a.breather, and then repeat this up to five times With each.repetition, go down just a little bit more Stretch into.it, challenge those muscles to open Up those joints and if it.is locked up, you might get a sudden pop crack or self.release With this one too, what I'm going to do is then.take it to the next level by just angling my body out a.little bit towards one side So, in this case, I'm going a.little bit towards my right I'm going to repeat this What.you're going to notice is it opens the back up just a little.bit differently So, experiment with different angles Go all.the way towards the right and then go all the way towards the.left If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot.like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw.more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most.So, here's an upper back self-release exercise that you.can pretty much do anywhere The only thing that we need is.a corner of a wall or a door I'm going to show two parts to.this because they're going to target two different locations.The first part, we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that.a lot of people get pain which is right here at the base of.the neck into the upper back across the shoulders This is.known as an upper trapezius stretch Very easy to do When.I go to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees, and then.slide it across my lower back as much as I can You'll feel.this muscle right up here start to relax That's the trapezius.muscle From there, I'm going to take my hand, place it on.the side right here, and then I'm just going to take my ear.towards the shoulder, the other side shoulder When you do.this, you'll really feel it open up into the neck right.here and a lot of times you'll get a sudden pop, crack, or.release into the neck or into the upper back It usually.feels really good Again, with this one, don't try to sit You.want to hold this one for about 15 to 20 seconds You're just.going to relax and then on the next repetition, drive the arm.over a little bit more and then take the ear down towards the.shoulder even more Get a better stretch each time And I.would do this on both sides to keep them in balance To focus.a little bit more down into the upper back and middle backs,.let's go right up here and do what I like to call the Y.stretch So, I'm going to put my arms up just like this to.the point where I can then lean into it like this So, I'm.putting my Y or my arms into a Y My feet go together and then.I'm just using my body weight to lean forward towards the.corner of that wall This feels really good You'll feel the.stretch into the chest but you'll also feel the shoulder.blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back You.may feel again a sudden pop or release Hold this for about 20.seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five.times You can also try different variations So,.instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call.the field goal and then do the same thing You'll notice that.it just open up the back just a little bit differently From.there, you can also go into a W but go through all three.motions I don't know if you just heard it over the.microphone but I got a pretty good release right there and I.just try to do all three motions, three to five.repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into.it and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release So,.here's what is known as an upper back corkscrew stretch.and it's a very good upper back opener because we can do a.little bit of rotation in there to get those joints moving.This one is done at the edge of the bed but you can also do.this one on the floor What I'm going to do is start with one.leg straight Usually the leg is closest towards the edge of.the bed and then the other side, what I'm gonna do is bend.the knee and then keep the foot flat I'm just going to press.into the side of my calf right here with that foot and press.down for stable anchor point Let's take the hand that's.closest towards the edge of the bed, grab onto the edge just.for a little bit more support What I'm going to do from there is.bend the other side's arms So, in this case, I'm gonna take my.right elbow and I weigh place it on the inside of my right.knee from there I'm going to press into it already you.should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back.a very good rotation because we're going towards the left.from here what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then.just turn my upper body to look away from me so kinda like.rotating a little bit towards my left the more that you turn.like this the more it's going to open up the back and you.might get a sudden pop crack or self release don't to force.this one just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is.going to go it will go but you want to hold this stretch for.about 20 seconds and it really feels good and then from there.I just relax take a breather and then I repeat this up to.five times with each repetition you can stretch into it just a.little bit more again don't try to force anything and then when.you're done on one side always switch to the other to keep.them both in balance my personal favorite way to self.release the upper back is with an extension exercise that you.can do on the floor The easiest way to do this exercise.is with a foam roller I know a lot of people don't have foam.rollers so I want to give different options.Surprisingly, using an extra large athletic or sports cup.really contours to the shape of the back and works very well.You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis.balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it, and tied it That.way, you can put the spine directly in between the two.balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise but.I'd like to keep things simple I'm going to be using my trusty.can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel.over the can of soup or the sports cup The other two, you.don't need a towel So, for demonstrated purposes, I will.be using my can of soup So, if you are using the soup can,.just place it in the middle of a large bath towel just like.this and then roll it up and you kinda have a homemade foam.roller From there, I'm just going to position it right on.the upper back So, I just go like this and it's pretty much.sent right over the spine itself What I can do from.there is just take my hands, place them on the back of the.head just like this and then just simply use my legs to roll.up and down from the middle to upper back We don't want to do.this one on the lower back because that can cause.irritation But just roll up and down, just allowing gravity.to take your shoulders, elbows, and head down just like this.and with this rolling motion, you might get a sudden pop.crack or self release but you can do this one nice and slow.up and down for about five to 10 complete repetitions If you.do use the athletic cup, you probably won't be able to do.this certain step but you should be able to do the.others So, let's say that you have one spot that just will.not release It's really tight, achy, and painful It needs a.little bit more tension Let's stop right over that spot From.there, what I'm going to do is just allow gravity to take my.head, my shoulders, and elbows down towards the floor as much.as we can Really put the back into a backwards extension just.like this and then from there, I'm going to plant my feet on.the floor and then lift my butt up Kinda like creating a.bridge-like exercise This time, what's going to happen is.that your upper body weight is going to drive down into the.can into the floor and it really intensifies the stretch.It feels really, really good for me and if that joint is.locked up, this might get it to self release but you can hold.this position for 15 to 20 seconds If it feels good, hold.it for longer You can hold it upwards towards a minute but.when you need a breather, just lower your butt down like this.and then repeat it about three to five times from there you.can just switch over different spots as needed if it still.feels like it does not want to release what we can do from.there is incorporate a little bit more dynamic movement so.this time around what I'm going to do is take my arms off like.this create like a field goal position with my arms let my.head go down towards the floor and then just wing the elbows.down towards the floor what this will do is it stretches.the chest opens the pack up just a little bit differently.and might get it to finally self release or pop but.challenge yourself to bring the elbows down as much as you can.You can hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds, relax, and then.repeat You can also do what are known as floor angels So,.go down all the way right here Lower the hands down towards or.I should say the back side are going to be towards the floor.and then from there, I'm going to wing my elbows down as much.as I can and then just raise my arms overhead just like this.You'll feel the again, the muscles just get hit a little.bit differently and that might just help If you feel like.it's still needs a little bit more tension, you can put a.little bit more of a passive stretch in there So, what I'm.going to do is just allow my head and my shoulders to go all.the way down towards the floor I'm going to straighten my arms.out like this straight at the elbow Hands are going to.overlap and then, I'm going to lower my hands down towards the.floor as much as I can The more that you lower this down,.the more that you're going to feel that spot over the can in.the upper back really start to open Only go to your comfort.level but one we've had a very deep but comfortable stretch.What I'm going to do from there is just wing my arms down just a.little bit like this This will offer a little bit more passive.stretch into the upper back and you might get it to.self-release I don't know if you just heard it on the.microphone right there but I did get a little bit of a.release but just go very comfortably Don't try to force.anything If it's going to go, it will go but you can do this.one right here for about five repetitions Just switch over.different spots as needed and I do hope that that one right.there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain.relief If the exercise is helped, please support the.channel by giving this video a like and maybe subscribing to.the channel too If you have any comments or questions,.please leave them below I'll get back to you as soon as I.can Thanks for watching!","{'(0.0, 2.292)': ""This video, I'm going to show you how to self-release your"", '(2.292, 6.9319999999999995)': 'upper back for instant pain relief Stay tuned', '(9.072,

_bZHLRfVYtU,How to do an upper back opener exercise using edge of the bed to self-release your upper back for instant pain relief?,"(174, 279)",for extra comfort Lets go right up to that flat elevated.surface Im going to bend the arm like this and place the.backside of my arms flat on that elevated surface Lets.press down a little bit too just to create a stable anchor.point My hand theyre going to go on my upper back right.across the shoulders just like this From here Im going to.tuck my chin towards my chest The movement is very easy Im.just going to simply lower my body weight Kinda like taking.my butt down towards my heels Also during this Im going to.let my chest go towards the edge of that flat elevated.surface as much as we can The more that you go down the more.that youre going to feel a good stretch happening into the.upper back that goes all the way down to the middle and.lower back So it usually feels really and if there is a.segment thats locked up this will help open it up through.kind of a decompression traction pull but go down as.far as youre able to go Once you feel that comfortable.stretch lets hold this for 20 seconds Do nice slow.controlled breathing also Let that tension out The more you.relax the more results that youre gonna get with this.From there Im just going to relax come back up take a.breather and then repeat this up to five times With each.repetition go down just a little bit more Stretch into.it challenge those muscles to open Up those joints and if it.is locked up you might get a sudden pop crack or self.release With this one too what Im going to do is then.take it to the next level by just angling my body out a.little bit towards one side So in this case Im going a.little bit towards my right Im going to repeat this What.youre going to notice is it opens the back up just a little.bit differently So experiment with different angles Go all.the way towards the right and then go all the way towards the.left If you feel that one certain angle one certain spot.like right here for me hits it just a little bit more throw.more repetitions in target the spots that need it the most,"This video, I'm going to show you how to self-release your.upper back for instant pain relief Stay tuned.Hey, everyone Dr Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St.Joseph, Michigan If you're dealing with a tight, locked.up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self.release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not.going to want to miss I'm going to go over different.exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back.and give quick relief, even in as little as 30 seconds As a.side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments They.don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments.They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a.satisfying pop, crack, or release So, let's get started.and get the upper back feeling better Right now So, here is.an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in.the morning or before you go to bed at night I'm going to lay.flat on my back just like this Let's take our hands, place.them behind our head for a little bit of support What I'm.gonna do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head.right off the edge of the bed We want to focus on just.letting gravity take our body weight So, it's just taking my.head and shoulders and arms downwards like The more that.you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch.over the area where your upper back is placed over the bed.So, you want to go down as far as you're able to go just.letting gravity take it From there, what I do is wing my.elbows down just a little bit and then push down with my.head This will create a passive stretch into the upper.back and if it is locked up, you may feel it go pop, click,.or crack Again, that is just gases being released from the.joints You want to hold this about five seconds you're just.going to relax take a breather and then you're going to repeat.so just press down a little bit more with this next repetition.to open up the back just a little bit more but you can do.this for about three to 5 repetitions from there I just.slide down a little bit and then repeat pretty much all the.way from the upper back to the middle back with this one too.the further that you go down the more that you're going to.be able to go downwards like this so only go to your comfort.level if you do find that one particular spot is the spot.that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right.over that spot and then at this point, what we're going to do.is wing the elbows down like this We're going to push down.with the head to create that passive traction and hopefully,.this will get it to release If it doesn't, you can put a.little bit more passive stretch in there by just quickly.winging the elbows down just a little bit and I don't know if.you heard it over the microphone but I got a very.good release into my upper back right there but this is a good.way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding.up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that.need it the most So, here is a great upper back opener that.you can do at the edge of a bed You can also use the.armrest of a couch, a desk, or a chair It just needs to be.flat and elevated We're also going to start off on our.knees So, make sure to put a pillow or towel underneath them.for extra comfort Let's go right up to that flat elevated.surface I'm going to bend the arm like this and place the.backside of my arms flat on that elevated surface Let's.press down a little bit too just to create a stable anchor.point My hand they're going to go on my upper back right.across the shoulders just like this From here, I'm going to.tuck my chin towards my chest The movement is very easy I'm.just going to simply lower my body weight Kinda like taking.my butt down towards my heels Also, during this, I'm going to.let my chest go towards the edge of that flat elevated.surface as much as we can The more that you go down, the more.that you're going to feel a good stretch happening into the.upper back that goes all the way down to the middle and.lower back So, it usually feels really and if there is a.segment that's locked up, this will help open it up through.kind of a decompression traction pull but go down as.far as you're able to go Once you feel that comfortable.stretch, let's hold this for 20 seconds Do nice, slow,.controlled breathing also Let that tension out The more you.relax, the more results that you're gonna get with this.From there, I'm just going to relax, come back up, take a.breather, and then repeat this up to five times With each.repetition, go down just a little bit more Stretch into.it, challenge those muscles to open Up those joints and if it.is locked up, you might get a sudden pop crack or self.release With this one too, what I'm going to do is then.take it to the next level by just angling my body out a.little bit towards one side So, in this case, I'm going a.little bit towards my right I'm going to repeat this What.you're going to notice is it opens the back up just a little.bit differently So, experiment with different angles Go all.the way towards the right and then go all the way towards the.left If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot.like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw.more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most.So, here's an upper back self-release exercise that you.can pretty much do anywhere The only thing that we need is.a corner of a wall or a door I'm going to show two parts to.this because they're going to target two different locations.The first part, we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that.a lot of people get pain which is right here at the base of.the neck into the upper back across the shoulders This is.known as an upper trapezius stretch Very easy to do When.I go to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees, and then.slide it across my lower back as much as I can You'll feel.this muscle right up here start to relax That's the trapezius.muscle From there, I'm going to take my hand, place it on.the side right here, and then I'm just going to take my ear.towards the shoulder, the other side shoulder When you do.this, you'll really feel it open up into the neck right.here and a lot of times you'll get a sudden pop, crack, or.release into the neck or into the upper back It usually.feels really good Again, with this one, don't try to sit You.want to hold this one for about 15 to 20 seconds You're just.going to relax and then on the next repetition, drive the arm.over a little bit more and then take the ear down towards the.shoulder even more Get a better stretch each time And I.would do this on both sides to keep them in balance To focus.a little bit more down into the upper back and middle backs,.let's go right up here and do what I like to call the Y.stretch So, I'm going to put my arms up just like this to.the point where I can then lean into it like this So, I'm.putting my Y or my arms into a Y My feet go together and then.I'm just using my body weight to lean forward towards the.corner of that wall This feels really good You'll feel the.stretch into the chest but you'll also feel the shoulder.blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back You.may feel again a sudden pop or release Hold this for about 20.seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five.times You can also try different variations So,.instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call.the field goal and then do the same thing You'll notice that.it just open up the back just a little bit differently From.there, you can also go into a W but go through all three.motions I don't know if you just heard it over the.microphone but I got a pretty good release right there and I.just try to do all three motions, three to five.repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into.it and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release So,.here's what is known as an upper back corkscrew stretch.and it's a very good upper back opener because we can do a.little bit of rotation in there to get those joints moving.This one is done at the edge of the bed but you can also do.this one on the floor What I'm going to do is start with one.leg straight Usually the leg is closest towards the edge of.the bed and then the other side, what I'm gonna do is bend.the knee and then keep the foot flat I'm just going to press.into the side of my calf right here with that foot and press.down for stable anchor point Let's take the hand that's.closest towards the edge of the bed, grab onto the edge just.for a little bit more support What I'm going to do from there is.bend the other side's arms So, in this case, I'm gonna take my.right elbow and I weigh place it on the inside of my right.knee from there I'm going to press into it already you.should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back.a very good rotation because we're going towards the left.from here what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then.just turn my upper body to look away from me so kinda like.rotating a little bit towards my left the more that you turn.like this the more it's going to open up the back and you.might get a sudden pop crack or self release don't to force.this one just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is.going to go it will go but you want to hold this stretch for.about 20 seconds and it really feels good and then from there.I just relax take a breather and then I repeat this up to.five times with each repetition you can stretch into it just a.little bit more again don't try to force anything and then when.you're done on one side always switch to the other to keep.them both in balance my personal favorite way to self.release the upper back is with an extension exercise that you.can do on the floor The easiest way to do this exercise.is with a foam roller I know a lot of people don't have foam.rollers so I want to give different options.Surprisingly, using an extra large athletic or sports cup.really contours to the shape of the back and works very well.You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis.balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it, and tied it That.way, you can put the spine directly in between the two.balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise but.I'd like to keep things simple I'm going to be using my trusty.can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel.over the can of soup or the sports cup The other two, you.don't need a towel So, for demonstrated purposes, I will.be using my can of soup So, if you are using the soup can,.just place it in the middle of a large bath towel just like.this and then roll it up and you kinda have a homemade foam.roller From there, I'm just going to position it right on.the upper back So, I just go like this and it's pretty much.sent right over the spine itself What I can do from.there is just take my hands, place them on the back of the.head just like this and then just simply use my legs to roll.up and down from the middle to upper back We don't want to do.this one on the lower back because that can cause.irritation But just roll up and down, just allowing gravity.to take your shoulders, elbows, and head down just like this.and with this rolling motion, you might get a sudden pop.crack or self release but you can do this one nice and slow.up and down for about five to 10 complete repetitions If you.do use the athletic cup, you probably won't be able to do.this certain step but you should be able to do the.others So, let's say that you have one spot that just will.not release It's really tight, achy, and painful It needs a.little bit more tension Let's stop right over that spot From.there, what I'm going to do is just allow gravity to take my.head, my shoulders, and elbows down towards the floor as much.as we can Really put the back into a backwards extension just.like this and then from there, I'm going to plant my feet on.the floor and then lift my butt up Kinda like creating a.bridge-like exercise This time, what's going to happen is.that your upper body weight is going to drive down into the.can into the floor and it really intensifies the stretch.It feels really, really good for me and if that joint is.locked up, this might get it to self release but you can hold.this position for 15 to 20 seconds If it feels good, hold.it for longer You can hold it upwards towards a minute but.when you need a breather, just lower your butt down like this.and then repeat it about three to five times from there you.can just switch over different spots as needed if it still.feels like it does not want to release what we can do from.there is incorporate a little bit more dynamic movement so.this time around what I'm going to do is take my arms off like.this create like a field goal position with my arms let my.head go down towards the floor and then just wing the elbows.down towards the floor what this will do is it stretches.the chest opens the pack up just a little bit differently.and might get it to finally self release or pop but.challenge yourself to bring the elbows down as much as you can.You can hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds, relax, and then.repeat You can also do what are known as floor angels So,.go down all the way right here Lower the hands down towards or.I should say the back side are going to be towards the floor.and then from there, I'm going to wing my elbows down as much.as I can and then just raise my arms overhead just like this.You'll feel the again, the muscles just get hit a little.bit differently and that might just help If you feel like.it's still needs a little bit more tension, you can put a.little bit more of a passive stretch in there So, what I'm.going to do is just allow my head and my shoulders to go all.the way down towards the floor I'm going to straighten my arms.out like this straight at the elbow Hands are going to.overlap and then, I'm going to lower my hands down towards the.floor as much as I can The more that you lower this down,.the more that you're going to feel that spot over the can in.the upper back really start to open Only go to your comfort.level but one we've had a very deep but comfortable stretch.What I'm going to do from there is just wing my arms down just a.little bit like this This will offer a little bit more passive.stretch into the upper back and you might get it to.self-release I don't know if you just heard it on the.microphone right there but I did get a little bit of a.release but just go very comfortably Don't try to force.anything If it's going to go, it will go but you can do this.one right here for about five repetitions Just switch over.different spots as needed and I do hope that that one right.there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain.relief If the exercise is helped, please support the.channel by giving this video a like and maybe subscribing to.the channel too If you have any comments or questions,.please leave them

_bZHLRfVYtU,How to do an upper trapezius self-release exercise using a corner of a wall?,"(305, 347)",I go to do is take one arm bend it at 90 degrees and then.slide it across my lower back as much as I can Youll feel.this muscle right up here start to relax Thats the trapezius.muscle From there Im going to take my hand place it on.the side right here and then Im just going to take my ear.towards the shoulder the other side shoulder When you do.this youll really feel it open up into the neck right.here and a lot of times youll get a sudden pop crack or.release into the neck or into the upper back It usually.feels really good Again with this one dont try to sit You.want to hold this one for about 15 to 20 seconds Youre just.going to relax and then on the next repetition drive the arm.over a little bit more and then take the ear down towards the.shoulder even more Get a better stretch each time And I.would do this on both sides to keep them in balance To focus,"This video, I'm going to show you how to self-release your.upper back for instant pain relief Stay tuned.Hey, everyone Dr Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St.Joseph, Michigan If you're dealing with a tight, locked.up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self.release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not.going to want to miss I'm going to go over different.exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back.and give quick relief, even in as little as 30 seconds As a.side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments They.don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments.They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a.satisfying pop, crack, or release So, let's get started.and get the upper back feeling better Right now So, here is.an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in.the morning or before you go to bed at night I'm going to lay.flat on my back just like this Let's take our hands, place.them behind our head for a little bit of support What I'm.gonna do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head.right off the edge of the bed We want to focus on just.letting gravity take our body weight So, it's just taking my.head and shoulders and arms downwards like The more that.you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch.over the area where your upper back is placed over the bed.So, you want to go down as far as you're able to go just.letting gravity take it From there, what I do is wing my.elbows down just a little bit and then push down with my.head This will create a passive stretch into the upper.back and if it is locked up, you may feel it go pop, click,.or crack Again, that is just gases being released from the.joints You want to hold this about five seconds you're just.going to relax take a breather and then you're going to repeat.so just press down a little bit more with this next repetition.to open up the back just a little bit more but you can do.this for about three to 5 repetitions from there I just.slide down a little bit and then repeat pretty much all the.way from the upper back to the middle back with this one too.the further that you go down the more that you're going to.be able to go downwards like this so only go to your comfort.level if you do find that one particular spot is the spot.that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right.over that spot and then at this point, what we're going to do.is wing the elbows down like this We're going to push down.with the head to create that passive traction and hopefully,.this will get it to release If it doesn't, you can put a.little bit more passive stretch in there by just quickly.winging the elbows down just a little bit and I don't know if.you heard it over the microphone but I got a very.good release into my upper back right there but this is a good.way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding.up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that.need it the most So, here is a great upper back opener that.you can do at the edge of a bed You can also use the.armrest of a couch, a desk, or a chair It just needs to be.flat and elevated We're also going to start off on our.knees So, make sure to put a pillow or towel underneath them.for extra comfort Let's go right up to that flat elevated.surface I'm going to bend the arm like this and place the.backside of my arms flat on that elevated surface Let's.press down a little bit too just to create a stable anchor.point My hand they're going to go on my upper back right.across the shoulders just like this From here, I'm going to.tuck my chin towards my chest The movement is very easy I'm.just going to simply lower my body weight Kinda like taking.my butt down towards my heels Also, during this, I'm going to.let my chest go towards the edge of that flat elevated.surface as much as we can The more that you go down, the more.that you're going to feel a good stretch happening into the.upper back that goes all the way down to the middle and.lower back So, it usually feels really and if there is a.segment that's locked up, this will help open it up through.kind of a decompression traction pull but go down as.far as you're able to go Once you feel that comfortable.stretch, let's hold this for 20 seconds Do nice, slow,.controlled breathing also Let that tension out The more you.relax, the more results that you're gonna get with this.From there, I'm just going to relax, come back up, take a.breather, and then repeat this up to five times With each.repetition, go down just a little bit more Stretch into.it, challenge those muscles to open Up those joints and if it.is locked up, you might get a sudden pop crack or self.release With this one too, what I'm going to do is then.take it to the next level by just angling my body out a.little bit towards one side So, in this case, I'm going a.little bit towards my right I'm going to repeat this What.you're going to notice is it opens the back up just a little.bit differently So, experiment with different angles Go all.the way towards the right and then go all the way towards the.left If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot.like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw.more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most.So, here's an upper back self-release exercise that you.can pretty much do anywhere The only thing that we need is.a corner of a wall or a door I'm going to show two parts to.this because they're going to target two different locations.The first part, we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that.a lot of people get pain which is right here at the base of.the neck into the upper back across the shoulders This is.known as an upper trapezius stretch Very easy to do When.I go to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees, and then.slide it across my lower back as much as I can You'll feel.this muscle right up here start to relax That's the trapezius.muscle From there, I'm going to take my hand, place it on.the side right here, and then I'm just going to take my ear.towards the shoulder, the other side shoulder When you do.this, you'll really feel it open up into the neck right.here and a lot of times you'll get a sudden pop, crack, or.release into the neck or into the upper back It usually.feels really good Again, with this one, don't try to sit You.want to hold this one for about 15 to 20 seconds You're just.going to relax and then on the next repetition, drive the arm.over a little bit more and then take the ear down towards the.shoulder even more Get a better stretch each time And I.would do this on both sides to keep them in balance To focus.a little bit more down into the upper back and middle backs,.let's go right up here and do what I like to call the Y.stretch So, I'm going to put my arms up just like this to.the point where I can then lean into it like this So, I'm.putting my Y or my arms into a Y My feet go together and then.I'm just using my body weight to lean forward towards the.corner of that wall This feels really good You'll feel the.stretch into the chest but you'll also feel the shoulder.blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back You.may feel again a sudden pop or release Hold this for about 20.seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five.times You can also try different variations So,.instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call.the field goal and then do the same thing You'll notice that.it just open up the back just a little bit differently From.there, you can also go into a W but go through all three.motions I don't know if you just heard it over the.microphone but I got a pretty good release right there and I.just try to do all three motions, three to five.repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into.it and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release So,.here's what is known as an upper back corkscrew stretch.and it's a very good upper back opener because we can do a.little bit of rotation in there to get those joints moving.This one is done at the edge of the bed but you can also do.this one on the floor What I'm going to do is start with one.leg straight Usually the leg is closest towards the edge of.the bed and then the other side, what I'm gonna do is bend.the knee and then keep the foot flat I'm just going to press.into the side of my calf right here with that foot and press.down for stable anchor point Let's take the hand that's.closest towards the edge of the bed, grab onto the edge just.for a little bit more support What I'm going to do from there is.bend the other side's arms So, in this case, I'm gonna take my.right elbow and I weigh place it on the inside of my right.knee from there I'm going to press into it already you.should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back.a very good rotation because we're going towards the left.from here what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then.just turn my upper body to look away from me so kinda like.rotating a little bit towards my left the more that you turn.like this the more it's going to open up the back and you.might get a sudden pop crack or self release don't to force.this one just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is.going to go it will go but you want to hold this stretch for.about 20 seconds and it really feels good and then from there.I just relax take a breather and then I repeat this up to.five times with each repetition you can stretch into it just a.little bit more again don't try to force anything and then when.you're done on one side always switch to the other to keep.them both in balance my personal favorite way to self.release the upper back is with an extension exercise that you.can do on the floor The easiest way to do this exercise.is with a foam roller I know a lot of people don't have foam.rollers so I want to give different options.Surprisingly, using an extra large athletic or sports cup.really contours to the shape of the back and works very well.You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis.balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it, and tied it That.way, you can put the spine directly in between the two.balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise but.I'd like to keep things simple I'm going to be using my trusty.can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel.over the can of soup or the sports cup The other two, you.don't need a towel So, for demonstrated purposes, I will.be using my can of soup So, if you are using the soup can,.just place it in the middle of a large bath towel just like.this and then roll it up and you kinda have a homemade foam.roller From there, I'm just going to position it right on.the upper back So, I just go like this and it's pretty much.sent right over the spine itself What I can do from.there is just take my hands, place them on the back of the.head just like this and then just simply use my legs to roll.up and down from the middle to upper back We don't want to do.this one on the lower back because that can cause.irritation But just roll up and down, just allowing gravity.to take your shoulders, elbows, and head down just like this.and with this rolling motion, you might get a sudden pop.crack or self release but you can do this one nice and slow.up and down for about five to 10 complete repetitions If you.do use the athletic cup, you probably won't be able to do.this certain step but you should be able to do the.others So, let's say that you have one spot that just will.not release It's really tight, achy, and painful It needs a.little bit more tension Let's stop right over that spot From.there, what I'm going to do is just allow gravity to take my.head, my shoulders, and elbows down towards the floor as much.as we can Really put the back into a backwards extension just.like this and then from there, I'm going to plant my feet on.the floor and then lift my butt up Kinda like creating a.bridge-like exercise This time, what's going to happen is.that your upper body weight is going to drive down into the.can into the floor and it really intensifies the stretch.It feels really, really good for me and if that joint is.locked up, this might get it to self release but you can hold.this position for 15 to 20 seconds If it feels good, hold.it for longer You can hold it upwards towards a minute but.when you need a breather, just lower your butt down like this.and then repeat it about three to five times from there you.can just switch over different spots as needed if it still.feels like it does not want to release what we can do from.there is incorporate a little bit more dynamic movement so.this time around what I'm going to do is take my arms off like.this create like a field goal position with my arms let my.head go down towards the floor and then just wing the elbows.down towards the floor what this will do is it stretches.the chest opens the pack up just a little bit differently.and might get it to finally self release or pop but.challenge yourself to bring the elbows down as much as you can.You can hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds, relax, and then.repeat You can also do what are known as floor angels So,.go down all the way right here Lower the hands down towards or.I should say the back side are going to be towards the floor.and then from there, I'm going to wing my elbows down as much.as I can and then just raise my arms overhead just like this.You'll feel the again, the muscles just get hit a little.bit differently and that might just help If you feel like.it's still needs a little bit more tension, you can put a.little bit more of a passive stretch in there So, what I'm.going to do is just allow my head and my shoulders to go all.the way down towards the floor I'm going to straighten my arms.out like this straight at the elbow Hands are going to.overlap and then, I'm going to lower my hands down towards the.floor as much as I can The more that you lower this down,.the more that you're going to feel that spot over the can in.the upper back really start to open Only go to your comfort.level but one we've had a very deep but comfortable stretch.What I'm going to do from there is just wing my arms down just a.little bit like this This will offer a little bit more passive.stretch into the upper back and you might get it to.self-release I don't know if you just heard it on the.microphone right there but I did get a little bit of a.release but just go very comfortably Don't try to force.anything If it's going to go, it will go but you can do this.one right here for about five repetitions Just switch over.different spots as needed and I do hope that that one right.there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain.relief If the exercise is helped, please support the.channel by giving this video a like and maybe subscribing to.the channel too

_bZHLRfVYtU,How to do a Y stretch exercise using a corner of a wall to self-release your upper back for instant pain relief?,"(354, 407)",lets go right up here and do what I like to call the Y.stretch So Im going to put my arms up just like this to.the point where I can then lean into it like this So Im.putting my Y or my arms into a Y My feet go together and then.Im just using my body weight to lean forward towards the.corner of that wall This feels really good Youll feel the.stretch into the chest but youll also feel the shoulder.blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back You.may feel again a sudden pop or release Hold this for about 20.seconds relax and then try to repeat this three to five.times You can also try different variations So.instead of going towards the Y go towards what I like to call.the field goal and then do the same thing Youll notice that.it just open up the back just a little bit differently From.there you can also go into a W but go through all three.motions I dont know if you just heard it over the.microphone but I got a pretty good release right there and I.just try to do all three motions three to five.repetitions each repetition stretch a little bit more into,"This video, I'm going to show you how to self-release your.upper back for instant pain relief Stay tuned.Hey, everyone Dr Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St.Joseph, Michigan If you're dealing with a tight, locked.up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self.release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not.going to want to miss I'm going to go over different.exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back.and give quick relief, even in as little as 30 seconds As a.side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments They.don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments.They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a.satisfying pop, crack, or release So, let's get started.and get the upper back feeling better Right now So, here is.an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in.the morning or before you go to bed at night I'm going to lay.flat on my back just like this Let's take our hands, place.them behind our head for a little bit of support What I'm.gonna do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head.right off the edge of the bed We want to focus on just.letting gravity take our body weight So, it's just taking my.head and shoulders and arms downwards like The more that.you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch.over the area where your upper back is placed over the bed.So, you want to go down as far as you're able to go just.letting gravity take it From there, what I do is wing my.elbows down just a little bit and then push down with my.head This will create a passive stretch into the upper.back and if it is locked up, you may feel it go pop, click,.or crack Again, that is just gases being released from the.joints You want to hold this about five seconds you're just.going to relax take a breather and then you're going to repeat.so just press down a little bit more with this next repetition.to open up the back just a little bit more but you can do.this for about three to 5 repetitions from there I just.slide down a little bit and then repeat pretty much all the.way from the upper back to the middle back with this one too.the further that you go down the more that you're going to.be able to go downwards like this so only go to your comfort.level if you do find that one particular spot is the spot.that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right.over that spot and then at this point, what we're going to do.is wing the elbows down like this We're going to push down.with the head to create that passive traction and hopefully,.this will get it to release If it doesn't, you can put a.little bit more passive stretch in there by just quickly.winging the elbows down just a little bit and I don't know if.you heard it over the microphone but I got a very.good release into my upper back right there but this is a good.way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding.up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that.need it the most So, here is a great upper back opener that.you can do at the edge of a bed You can also use the.armrest of a couch, a desk, or a chair It just needs to be.flat and elevated We're also going to start off on our.knees So, make sure to put a pillow or towel underneath them.for extra comfort Let's go right up to that flat elevated.surface I'm going to bend the arm like this and place the.backside of my arms flat on that elevated surface Let's.press down a little bit too just to create a stable anchor.point My hand they're going to go on my upper back right.across the shoulders just like this From here, I'm going to.tuck my chin towards my chest The movement is very easy I'm.just going to simply lower my body weight Kinda like taking.my butt down towards my heels Also, during this, I'm going to.let my chest go towards the edge of that flat elevated.surface as much as we can The more that you go down, the more.that you're going to feel a good stretch happening into the.upper back that goes all the way down to the middle and.lower back So, it usually feels really and if there is a.segment that's locked up, this will help open it up through.kind of a decompression traction pull but go down as.far as you're able to go Once you feel that comfortable.stretch, let's hold this for 20 seconds Do nice, slow,.controlled breathing also Let that tension out The more you.relax, the more results that you're gonna get with this.From there, I'm just going to relax, come back up, take a.breather, and then repeat this up to five times With each.repetition, go down just a little bit more Stretch into.it, challenge those muscles to open Up those joints and if it.is locked up, you might get a sudden pop crack or self.release With this one too, what I'm going to do is then.take it to the next level by just angling my body out a.little bit towards one side So, in this case, I'm going a.little bit towards my right I'm going to repeat this What.you're going to notice is it opens the back up just a little.bit differently So, experiment with different angles Go all.the way towards the right and then go all the way towards the.left If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot.like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw.more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most.So, here's an upper back self-release exercise that you.can pretty much do anywhere The only thing that we need is.a corner of a wall or a door I'm going to show two parts to.this because they're going to target two different locations.The first part, we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that.a lot of people get pain which is right here at the base of.the neck into the upper back across the shoulders This is.known as an upper trapezius stretch Very easy to do When.I go to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees, and then.slide it across my lower back as much as I can You'll feel.this muscle right up here start to relax That's the trapezius.muscle From there, I'm going to take my hand, place it on.the side right here, and then I'm just going to take my ear.towards the shoulder, the other side shoulder When you do.this, you'll really feel it open up into the neck right.here and a lot of times you'll get a sudden pop, crack, or.release into the neck or into the upper back It usually.feels really good Again, with this one, don't try to sit You.want to hold this one for about 15 to 20 seconds You're just.going to relax and then on the next repetition, drive the arm.over a little bit more and then take the ear down towards the.shoulder even more Get a better stretch each time And I.would do this on both sides to keep them in balance To focus.a little bit more down into the upper back and middle backs,.let's go right up here and do what I like to call the Y.stretch So, I'm going to put my arms up just like this to.the point where I can then lean into it like this So, I'm.putting my Y or my arms into a Y My feet go together and then.I'm just using my body weight to lean forward towards the.corner of that wall This feels really good You'll feel the.stretch into the chest but you'll also feel the shoulder.blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back You.may feel again a sudden pop or release Hold this for about 20.seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five.times You can also try different variations So,.instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call.the field goal and then do the same thing You'll notice that.it just open up the back just a little bit differently From.there, you can also go into a W but go through all three.motions I don't know if you just heard it over the.microphone but I got a pretty good release right there and I.just try to do all three motions, three to five.repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into.it and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release So,.here's what is known as an upper back corkscrew stretch.and it's a very good upper back opener because we can do a.little bit of rotation in there to get those joints moving.This one is done at the edge of the bed but you can also do.this one on the floor What I'm going to do is start with one.leg straight Usually the leg is closest towards the edge of.the bed and then the other side, what I'm gonna do is bend.the knee and then keep the foot flat I'm just going to press.into the side of my calf right here with that foot and press.down for stable anchor point Let's take the hand that's.closest towards the edge of the bed, grab onto the edge just.for a little bit more support What I'm going to do from there is.bend the other side's arms So, in this case, I'm gonna take my.right elbow and I weigh place it on the inside of my right.knee from there I'm going to press into it already you.should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back.a very good rotation because we're going towards the left.from here what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then.just turn my upper body to look away from me so kinda like.rotating a little bit towards my left the more that you turn.like this the more it's going to open up the back and you.might get a sudden pop crack or self release don't to force.this one just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is.going to go it will go but you want to hold this stretch for.about 20 seconds and it really feels good and then from there.I just relax take a breather and then I repeat this up to.five times with each repetition you can stretch into it just a.little bit more again don't try to force anything and then when.you're done on one side always switch to the other to keep.them both in balance my personal favorite way to self.release the upper back is with an extension exercise that you.can do on the floor The easiest way to do this exercise.is with a foam roller I know a lot of people don't have foam.rollers so I want to give different options.Surprisingly, using an extra large athletic or sports cup.really contours to the shape of the back and works very well.You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis.balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it, and tied it That.way, you can put the spine directly in between the two.balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise but.I'd like to keep things simple I'm going to be using my trusty.can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel.over the can of soup or the sports cup The other two, you.don't need a towel So, for demonstrated purposes, I will.be using my can of soup So, if you are using the soup can,.just place it in the middle of a large bath towel just like.this and then roll it up and you kinda have a homemade foam.roller From there, I'm just going to position it right on.the upper back So, I just go like this and it's pretty much.sent right over the spine itself What I can do from.there is just take my hands, place them on the back of the.head just like this and then just simply use my legs to roll.up and down from the middle to upper back We don't want to do.this one on the lower back because that can cause.irritation But just roll up and down, just allowing gravity.to take your shoulders, elbows, and head down just like this.and with this rolling motion, you might get a sudden pop.crack or self release but you can do this one nice and slow.up and down for about five to 10 complete repetitions If you.do use the athletic cup, you probably won't be able to do.this certain step but you should be able to do the.others So, let's say that you have one spot that just will.not release It's really tight, achy, and painful It needs a.little bit more tension Let's stop right over that spot From.there, what I'm going to do is just allow gravity to take my.head, my shoulders, and elbows down towards the floor as much.as we can Really put the back into a backwards extension just.like this and then from there, I'm going to plant my feet on.the floor and then lift my butt up Kinda like creating a.bridge-like exercise This time, what's going to happen is.that your upper body weight is going to drive down into the.can into the floor and it really intensifies the stretch.It feels really, really good for me and if that joint is.locked up, this might get it to self release but you can hold.this position for 15 to 20 seconds If it feels good, hold.it for longer You can hold it upwards towards a minute but.when you need a breather, just lower your butt down like this.and then repeat it about three to five times from there you.can just switch over different spots as needed if it still.feels like it does not want to release what we can do from.there is incorporate a little bit more dynamic movement so.this time around what I'm going to do is take my arms off like.this create like a field goal position with my arms let my.head go down towards the floor and then just wing the elbows.down towards the floor what this will do is it stretches.the chest opens the pack up just a little bit differently.and might get it to finally self release or pop but.challenge yourself to bring the elbows down as much as you can.You can hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds, relax, and then.repeat You can also do what are known as floor angels So,.go down all the way right here Lower the hands down towards or.I should say the back side are going to be towards the floor.and then from there, I'm going to wing my elbows down as much.as I can and then just raise my arms overhead just like this.You'll feel the again, the muscles just get hit a little.bit differently and that might just help If you feel like.it's still needs a little bit more tension, you can put a.little bit more of a passive stretch in there So, what I'm.going to do is just allow my head and my shoulders to go all.the way down towards the floor I'm going to straighten my arms.out like this straight at the elbow Hands are going to.overlap and then, I'm going to lower my hands down towards the.floor as much as I can The more that you lower this down,.the more that you're going to feel that spot over the can in.the upper back really start to open Only go to your comfort.level but one we've had a very deep but comfortable stretch.What I'm going to do from there is just wing my arms down just a.little bit like this This will offer a little bit more passive.stretch into the upper back and you might get it to.self-release I don't know if you just heard it on the.microphone right there but I did get a little bit of a.release but just go very comfortably Don't try to force.anything If it's going to go, it will go but you can do this.one right here for about five repetitions Just switch over.different spots as needed and I do hope that that one right.there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain.relief If the exercise is helped, please support the.channel by giving this video a like and maybe subscribing to.the channel too If you have any comments or questions,.please leave them below I'll get back to you as soon as I.can Thanks for watching!","{'(0.0, 2.292)':

_bZHLRfVYtU,How to do an upper back corkscrew stretch to self-release your upper back for instant pain relief?,"(429, 505)",leg straight Usually the leg is closest towards the edge of.the bed and then the other side what Im gonna do is bend.the knee and then keep the foot flat Im just going to press.into the side of my calf right here with that foot and press.down for stable anchor point Lets take the hand thats.closest towards the edge of the bed grab onto the edge just.for a little bit more support What Im going to do from there is.bend the other sides arms So in this case Im gonna take my.right elbow and I weigh place it on the inside of my right.knee from there Im going to press into it already you.should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back.a very good rotation because were going towards the left.from here what Im going to do is press into my knee and then.just turn my upper body to look away from me so kinda like.rotating a little bit towards my left the more that you turn.like this the more its going to open up the back and you.might get a sudden pop crack or self release dont to force.this one just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is.going to go it will go but you want to hold this stretch for.about 20 seconds and it really feels good and then from there.I just relax take a breather and then I repeat this up to.five times with each repetition you can stretch into it just a.little bit more again dont try to force anything and then when.youre done on one side always switch to the other to keep.them both in balance my personal favorite way to self,"This video, I'm going to show you how to self-release your.upper back for instant pain relief Stay tuned.Hey, everyone Dr Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St.Joseph, Michigan If you're dealing with a tight, locked.up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self.release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not.going to want to miss I'm going to go over different.exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back.and give quick relief, even in as little as 30 seconds As a.side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments They.don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments.They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a.satisfying pop, crack, or release So, let's get started.and get the upper back feeling better Right now So, here is.an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in.the morning or before you go to bed at night I'm going to lay.flat on my back just like this Let's take our hands, place.them behind our head for a little bit of support What I'm.gonna do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head.right off the edge of the bed We want to focus on just.letting gravity take our body weight So, it's just taking my.head and shoulders and arms downwards like The more that.you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch.over the area where your upper back is placed over the bed.So, you want to go down as far as you're able to go just.letting gravity take it From there, what I do is wing my.elbows down just a little bit and then push down with my.head This will create a passive stretch into the upper.back and if it is locked up, you may feel it go pop, click,.or crack Again, that is just gases being released from the.joints You want to hold this about five seconds you're just.going to relax take a breather and then you're going to repeat.so just press down a little bit more with this next repetition.to open up the back just a little bit more but you can do.this for about three to 5 repetitions from there I just.slide down a little bit and then repeat pretty much all the.way from the upper back to the middle back with this one too.the further that you go down the more that you're going to.be able to go downwards like this so only go to your comfort.level if you do find that one particular spot is the spot.that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right.over that spot and then at this point, what we're going to do.is wing the elbows down like this We're going to push down.with the head to create that passive traction and hopefully,.this will get it to release If it doesn't, you can put a.little bit more passive stretch in there by just quickly.winging the elbows down just a little bit and I don't know if.you heard it over the microphone but I got a very.good release into my upper back right there but this is a good.way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding.up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that.need it the most So, here is a great upper back opener that.you can do at the edge of a bed You can also use the.armrest of a couch, a desk, or a chair It just needs to be.flat and elevated We're also going to start off on our.knees So, make sure to put a pillow or towel underneath them.for extra comfort Let's go right up to that flat elevated.surface I'm going to bend the arm like this and place the.backside of my arms flat on that elevated surface Let's.press down a little bit too just to create a stable anchor.point My hand they're going to go on my upper back right.across the shoulders just like this From here, I'm going to.tuck my chin towards my chest The movement is very easy I'm.just going to simply lower my body weight Kinda like taking.my butt down towards my heels Also, during this, I'm going to.let my chest go towards the edge of that flat elevated.surface as much as we can The more that you go down, the more.that you're going to feel a good stretch happening into the.upper back that goes all the way down to the middle and.lower back So, it usually feels really and if there is a.segment that's locked up, this will help open it up through.kind of a decompression traction pull but go down as.far as you're able to go Once you feel that comfortable.stretch, let's hold this for 20 seconds Do nice, slow,.controlled breathing also Let that tension out The more you.relax, the more results that you're gonna get with this.From there, I'm just going to relax, come back up, take a.breather, and then repeat this up to five times With each.repetition, go down just a little bit more Stretch into.it, challenge those muscles to open Up those joints and if it.is locked up, you might get a sudden pop crack or self.release With this one too, what I'm going to do is then.take it to the next level by just angling my body out a.little bit towards one side So, in this case, I'm going a.little bit towards my right I'm going to repeat this What.you're going to notice is it opens the back up just a little.bit differently So, experiment with different angles Go all.the way towards the right and then go all the way towards the.left If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot.like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw.more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most.So, here's an upper back self-release exercise that you.can pretty much do anywhere The only thing that we need is.a corner of a wall or a door I'm going to show two parts to.this because they're going to target two different locations.The first part, we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that.a lot of people get pain which is right here at the base of.the neck into the upper back across the shoulders This is.known as an upper trapezius stretch Very easy to do When.I go to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees, and then.slide it across my lower back as much as I can You'll feel.this muscle right up here start to relax That's the trapezius.muscle From there, I'm going to take my hand, place it on.the side right here, and then I'm just going to take my ear.towards the shoulder, the other side shoulder When you do.this, you'll really feel it open up into the neck right.here and a lot of times you'll get a sudden pop, crack, or.release into the neck or into the upper back It usually.feels really good Again, with this one, don't try to sit You.want to hold this one for about 15 to 20 seconds You're just.going to relax and then on the next repetition, drive the arm.over a little bit more and then take the ear down towards the.shoulder even more Get a better stretch each time And I.would do this on both sides to keep them in balance To focus.a little bit more down into the upper back and middle backs,.let's go right up here and do what I like to call the Y.stretch So, I'm going to put my arms up just like this to.the point where I can then lean into it like this So, I'm.putting my Y or my arms into a Y My feet go together and then.I'm just using my body weight to lean forward towards the.corner of that wall This feels really good You'll feel the.stretch into the chest but you'll also feel the shoulder.blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back You.may feel again a sudden pop or release Hold this for about 20.seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five.times You can also try different variations So,.instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call.the field goal and then do the same thing You'll notice that.it just open up the back just a little bit differently From.there, you can also go into a W but go through all three.motions I don't know if you just heard it over the.microphone but I got a pretty good release right there and I.just try to do all three motions, three to five.repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into.it and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release So,.here's what is known as an upper back corkscrew stretch.and it's a very good upper back opener because we can do a.little bit of rotation in there to get those joints moving.This one is done at the edge of the bed but you can also do.this one on the floor What I'm going to do is start with one.leg straight Usually the leg is closest towards the edge of.the bed and then the other side, what I'm gonna do is bend.the knee and then keep the foot flat I'm just going to press.into the side of my calf right here with that foot and press.down for stable anchor point Let's take the hand that's.closest towards the edge of the bed, grab onto the edge just.for a little bit more support What I'm going to do from there is.bend the other side's arms So, in this case, I'm gonna take my.right elbow and I weigh place it on the inside of my right.knee from there I'm going to press into it already you.should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back.a very good rotation because we're going towards the left.from here what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then.just turn my upper body to look away from me so kinda like.rotating a little bit towards my left the more that you turn.like this the more it's going to open up the back and you.might get a sudden pop crack or self release don't to force.this one just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is.going to go it will go but you want to hold this stretch for.about 20 seconds and it really feels good and then from there.I just relax take a breather and then I repeat this up to.five times with each repetition you can stretch into it just a.little bit more again don't try to force anything and then when.you're done on one side always switch to the other to keep.them both in balance my personal favorite way to self.release the upper back is with an extension exercise that you.can do on the floor The easiest way to do this exercise.is with a foam roller I know a lot of people don't have foam.rollers so I want to give different options.Surprisingly, using an extra large athletic or sports cup.really contours to the shape of the back and works very well.You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis.balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it, and tied it That.way, you can put the spine directly in between the two.balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise but.I'd like to keep things simple I'm going to be using my trusty.can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel.over the can of soup or the sports cup The other two, you.don't need a towel So, for demonstrated purposes, I will.be using my can of soup So, if you are using the soup can,.just place it in the middle of a large bath towel just like.this and then roll it up and you kinda have a homemade foam.roller From there, I'm just going to position it right on.the upper back So, I just go like this and it's pretty much.sent right over the spine itself What I can do from.there is just take my hands, place them on the back of the.head just like this and then just simply use my legs to roll.up and down from the middle to upper back We don't want to do.this one on the lower back because that can cause.irritation But just roll up and down, just allowing gravity.to take your shoulders, elbows, and head down just like this.and with this rolling motion, you might get a sudden pop.crack or self release but you can do this one nice and slow.up and down for about five to 10 complete repetitions If you.do use the athletic cup, you probably won't be able to do.this certain step but you should be able to do the.others So, let's say that you have one spot that just will.not release It's really tight, achy, and painful It needs a.little bit more tension Let's stop right over that spot From.there, what I'm going to do is just allow gravity to take my.head, my shoulders, and elbows down towards the floor as much.as we can Really put the back into a backwards extension just.like this and then from there, I'm going to plant my feet on.the floor and then lift my butt up Kinda like creating a.bridge-like exercise This time, what's going to happen is.that your upper body weight is going to drive down into the.can into the floor and it really intensifies the stretch.It feels really, really good for me and if that joint is.locked up, this might get it to self release but you can hold.this position for 15 to 20 seconds If it feels good, hold.it for longer You can hold it upwards towards a minute but.when you need a breather, just lower your butt down like this.and then repeat it about three to five times from there you.can just switch over different spots as needed if it still.feels like it does not want to release what we can do from.there is incorporate a little bit more dynamic movement so.this time around what I'm going to do is take my arms off like.this create like a field goal position with my arms let my.head go down towards the floor and then just wing the elbows.down towards the floor what this will do is it stretches.the chest opens the pack up just a little bit differently.and might get it to finally self release or pop but.challenge yourself to bring the elbows down as much as you can.You can hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds, relax, and then.repeat You can also do what are known as floor angels So,.go down all the way right here Lower the hands down towards or.I should say the back side are going to be towards the floor.and then from there, I'm going to wing my elbows down as much.as I can and then just raise my arms overhead just like this.You'll feel the again, the muscles just get hit a little.bit differently and that might just help If you feel like.it's still needs a little bit more tension, you can put a.little bit more of a passive stretch in there So, what I'm.going to do is just allow my head and my shoulders to go all.the way down towards the floor I'm going to straighten my arms.out like this straight at the elbow Hands are going to.overlap and then, I'm going to lower my hands down towards the.floor as much as I can The more that you lower this down,.the more that you're going to feel that spot over the can in.the upper back really start to open Only go to your comfort.level but one we've had a very deep but comfortable stretch.What I'm going to do from there is just wing my arms down just a.little bit like this This will offer a little bit more passive.stretch into the upper back and you might get it to.self-release I don't know if you just heard it on the.microphone right there but I did get a little bit of a.release but just go very comfortably Don't try to force.anything If it's going to go, it will go but you can do this.one right here for about five repetitions Just switch over.different spots as needed and I do hope that that one right.there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain.relief If the exercise is helped, please support the.channel by giving this video a like and maybe subscribing to.the channel too If you have any comments or questions,.please leave them below I'll get back to you as soon as I.can Thanks for watching!","{'(0.0, 2.292)': ""This video, I'm going to show you how

_bZHLRfVYtU,How to do an extension exercise to self-release your upper back for instant pain relief?,"(565, 669)",roller From there Im just going to position it right on.the upper back So I just go like this and its pretty much.sent right over the spine itself What I can do from.there is just take my hands place them on the back of the.head just like this and then just simply use my legs to roll.up and down from the middle to upper back We dont want to do.this one on the lower back because that can cause.irritation But just roll up and down just allowing gravity.to take your shoulders elbows and head down just like this.and with this rolling motion you might get a sudden pop.crack or self release but you can do this one nice and slow.up and down for about five to 10 complete repetitions If you.do use the athletic cup you probably wont be able to do.this certain step but you should be able to do the.others So lets say that you have one spot that just will.not release Its really tight achy and painful It needs a.little bit more tension Lets stop right over that spot From.there what Im going to do is just allow gravity to take my.head my shoulders and elbows down towards the floor as much.as we can Really put the back into a backwards extension just.like this and then from there Im going to plant my feet on.the floor and then lift my butt up Kinda like creating a.bridgelike exercise This time whats going to happen is.that your upper body weight is going to drive down into the.can into the floor and it really intensifies the stretch.It feels really really good for me and if that joint is.locked up this might get it to self release but you can hold.this position for 15 to 20 seconds If it feels good hold.it for longer You can hold it upwards towards a minute but.when you need a breather just lower your butt down like this.and then repeat it about three to five times from there you.can just switch over different spots as needed if it still.feels like it does not want to release what we can do from,"This video, I'm going to show you how to self-release your.upper back for instant pain relief Stay tuned.Hey, everyone Dr Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St.Joseph, Michigan If you're dealing with a tight, locked.up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self.release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not.going to want to miss I'm going to go over different.exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back.and give quick relief, even in as little as 30 seconds As a.side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments They.don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments.They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a.satisfying pop, crack, or release So, let's get started.and get the upper back feeling better Right now So, here is.an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in.the morning or before you go to bed at night I'm going to lay.flat on my back just like this Let's take our hands, place.them behind our head for a little bit of support What I'm.gonna do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head.right off the edge of the bed We want to focus on just.letting gravity take our body weight So, it's just taking my.head and shoulders and arms downwards like The more that.you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch.over the area where your upper back is placed over the bed.So, you want to go down as far as you're able to go just.letting gravity take it From there, what I do is wing my.elbows down just a little bit and then push down with my.head This will create a passive stretch into the upper.back and if it is locked up, you may feel it go pop, click,.or crack Again, that is just gases being released from the.joints You want to hold this about five seconds you're just.going to relax take a breather and then you're going to repeat.so just press down a little bit more with this next repetition.to open up the back just a little bit more but you can do.this for about three to 5 repetitions from there I just.slide down a little bit and then repeat pretty much all the.way from the upper back to the middle back with this one too.the further that you go down the more that you're going to.be able to go downwards like this so only go to your comfort.level if you do find that one particular spot is the spot.that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right.over that spot and then at this point, what we're going to do.is wing the elbows down like this We're going to push down.with the head to create that passive traction and hopefully,.this will get it to release If it doesn't, you can put a.little bit more passive stretch in there by just quickly.winging the elbows down just a little bit and I don't know if.you heard it over the microphone but I got a very.good release into my upper back right there but this is a good.way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding.up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that.need it the most So, here is a great upper back opener that.you can do at the edge of a bed You can also use the.armrest of a couch, a desk, or a chair It just needs to be.flat and elevated We're also going to start off on our.knees So, make sure to put a pillow or towel underneath them.for extra comfort Let's go right up to that flat elevated.surface I'm going to bend the arm like this and place the.backside of my arms flat on that elevated surface Let's.press down a little bit too just to create a stable anchor.point My hand they're going to go on my upper back right.across the shoulders just like this From here, I'm going to.tuck my chin towards my chest The movement is very easy I'm.just going to simply lower my body weight Kinda like taking.my butt down towards my heels Also, during this, I'm going to.let my chest go towards the edge of that flat elevated.surface as much as we can The more that you go down, the more.that you're going to feel a good stretch happening into the.upper back that goes all the way down to the middle and.lower back So, it usually feels really and if there is a.segment that's locked up, this will help open it up through.kind of a decompression traction pull but go down as.far as you're able to go Once you feel that comfortable.stretch, let's hold this for 20 seconds Do nice, slow,.controlled breathing also Let that tension out The more you.relax, the more results that you're gonna get with this.From there, I'm just going to relax, come back up, take a.breather, and then repeat this up to five times With each.repetition, go down just a little bit more Stretch into.it, challenge those muscles to open Up those joints and if it.is locked up, you might get a sudden pop crack or self.release With this one too, what I'm going to do is then.take it to the next level by just angling my body out a.little bit towards one side So, in this case, I'm going a.little bit towards my right I'm going to repeat this What.you're going to notice is it opens the back up just a little.bit differently So, experiment with different angles Go all.the way towards the right and then go all the way towards the.left If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot.like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw.more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most.So, here's an upper back self-release exercise that you.can pretty much do anywhere The only thing that we need is.a corner of a wall or a door I'm going to show two parts to.this because they're going to target two different locations.The first part, we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that.a lot of people get pain which is right here at the base of.the neck into the upper back across the shoulders This is.known as an upper trapezius stretch Very easy to do When.I go to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees, and then.slide it across my lower back as much as I can You'll feel.this muscle right up here start to relax That's the trapezius.muscle From there, I'm going to take my hand, place it on.the side right here, and then I'm just going to take my ear.towards the shoulder, the other side shoulder When you do.this, you'll really feel it open up into the neck right.here and a lot of times you'll get a sudden pop, crack, or.release into the neck or into the upper back It usually.feels really good Again, with this one, don't try to sit You.want to hold this one for about 15 to 20 seconds You're just.going to relax and then on the next repetition, drive the arm.over a little bit more and then take the ear down towards the.shoulder even more Get a better stretch each time And I.would do this on both sides to keep them in balance To focus.a little bit more down into the upper back and middle backs,.let's go right up here and do what I like to call the Y.stretch So, I'm going to put my arms up just like this to.the point where I can then lean into it like this So, I'm.putting my Y or my arms into a Y My feet go together and then.I'm just using my body weight to lean forward towards the.corner of that wall This feels really good You'll feel the.stretch into the chest but you'll also feel the shoulder.blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back You.may feel again a sudden pop or release Hold this for about 20.seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five.times You can also try different variations So,.instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call.the field goal and then do the same thing You'll notice that.it just open up the back just a little bit differently From.there, you can also go into a W but go through all three.motions I don't know if you just heard it over the.microphone but I got a pretty good release right there and I.just try to do all three motions, three to five.repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into.it and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release So,.here's what is known as an upper back corkscrew stretch.and it's a very good upper back opener because we can do a.little bit of rotation in there to get those joints moving.This one is done at the edge of the bed but you can also do.this one on the floor What I'm going to do is start with one.leg straight Usually the leg is closest towards the edge of.the bed and then the other side, what I'm gonna do is bend.the knee and then keep the foot flat I'm just going to press.into the side of my calf right here with that foot and press.down for stable anchor point Let's take the hand that's.closest towards the edge of the bed, grab onto the edge just.for a little bit more support What I'm going to do from there is.bend the other side's arms So, in this case, I'm gonna take my.right elbow and I weigh place it on the inside of my right.knee from there I'm going to press into it already you.should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back.a very good rotation because we're going towards the left.from here what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then.just turn my upper body to look away from me so kinda like.rotating a little bit towards my left the more that you turn.like this the more it's going to open up the back and you.might get a sudden pop crack or self release don't to force.this one just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is.going to go it will go but you want to hold this stretch for.about 20 seconds and it really feels good and then from there.I just relax take a breather and then I repeat this up to.five times with each repetition you can stretch into it just a.little bit more again don't try to force anything and then when.you're done on one side always switch to the other to keep.them both in balance my personal favorite way to self.release the upper back is with an extension exercise that you.can do on the floor The easiest way to do this exercise.is with a foam roller I know a lot of people don't have foam.rollers so I want to give different options.Surprisingly, using an extra large athletic or sports cup.really contours to the shape of the back and works very well.You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis.balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it, and tied it That.way, you can put the spine directly in between the two.balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise but.I'd like to keep things simple I'm going to be using my trusty.can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel.over the can of soup or the sports cup The other two, you.don't need a towel So, for demonstrated purposes, I will.be using my can of soup So, if you are using the soup can,.just place it in the middle of a large bath towel just like.this and then roll it up and you kinda have a homemade foam.roller From there, I'm just going to position it right on.the upper back So, I just go like this and it's pretty much.sent right over the spine itself What I can do from.there is just take my hands, place them on the back of the.head just like this and then just simply use my legs to roll.up and down from the middle to upper back We don't want to do.this one on the lower back because that can cause.irritation But just roll up and down, just allowing gravity.to take your shoulders, elbows, and head down just like this.and with this rolling motion, you might get a sudden pop.crack or self release but you can do this one nice and slow.up and down for about five to 10 complete repetitions If you.do use the athletic cup, you probably won't be able to do.this certain step but you should be able to do the.others So, let's say that you have one spot that just will.not release It's really tight, achy, and painful It needs a.little bit more tension Let's stop right over that spot From.there, what I'm going to do is just allow gravity to take my.head, my shoulders, and elbows down towards the floor as much.as we can Really put the back into a backwards extension just.like this and then from there, I'm going to plant my feet on.the floor and then lift my butt up Kinda like creating a.bridge-like exercise This time, what's going to happen is.that your upper body weight is going to drive down into the.can into the floor and it really intensifies the stretch.It feels really, really good for me and if that joint is.locked up, this might get it to self release but you can hold.this position for 15 to 20 seconds If it feels good, hold.it for longer You can hold it upwards towards a minute but.when you need a breather, just lower your butt down like this.and then repeat it about three to five times from there you.can just switch over different spots as needed if it still.feels like it does not want to release what we can do from.there is incorporate a little bit more dynamic movement so.this time around what I'm going to do is take my arms off like.this create like a field goal position with my arms let my.head go down towards the floor and then just wing the elbows.down towards the floor what this will do is it stretches.the chest opens the pack up just a little bit differently.and might get it to finally self release or pop but.challenge yourself to bring the elbows down as much as you can.You can hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds, relax, and then.repeat You can also do what are known as floor angels So,.go down all the way right here Lower the hands down towards or.I should say the back side are going to be towards the floor.and then from there, I'm going to wing my elbows down as much.as I can and then just raise my arms overhead just like this.You'll feel the again, the muscles just get hit a little.bit differently and that might just help If you feel like.it's still needs a little bit more tension, you can put a.little bit more of a passive stretch in there So, what I'm.going to do is just allow my head and my shoulders to go all.the way down towards the floor I'm going to straighten my arms.out like this straight at the elbow Hands are going to.overlap and then, I'm going to lower my hands down towards the.floor as much as I can The more that you lower this down,.the more that you're going to feel that spot over the can in.the upper back really start to open Only go to your comfort.level but one we've had a very deep but comfortable stretch.What I'm going to do from there is just wing my arms down just a.little bit like this This will offer a little bit more passive.stretch into the upper back and you might get it to.self-release I don't know if you just heard it on the.microphone right there but I did get a little bit of a.release but just go very comfortably Don't try to force.anything If it's going to go, it will go but you can do this.one right here for about five repetitions Just switch over.different spots as needed and I do hope that that one right.there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain.relief If the exercise is helped, please support the.channel by giving this video a like and maybe subscribing to.the channel too If you have any comments or questions,.please leave them below I'll get back to you as soon as

_bZHLRfVYtU,How can I do dynamic movements in an extension exercise to self-release your upper back for instant pain relief?,"(670, 773)",there is incorporate a little bit more dynamic movement so.this time around what Im going to do is take my arms off like.this create like a field goal position with my arms let my.head go down towards the floor and then just wing the elbows.down towards the floor what this will do is it stretches.the chest opens the pack up just a little bit differently.and might get it to finally self release or pop but.challenge yourself to bring the elbows down as much as you can.You can hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds relax and then.repeat You can also do what are known as floor angels So.go down all the way right here Lower the hands down towards or.I should say the back side are going to be towards the floor.and then from there Im going to wing my elbows down as much.as I can and then just raise my arms overhead just like this.Youll feel the again the muscles just get hit a little.bit differently and that might just help If you feel like.its still needs a little bit more tension you can put a.little bit more of a passive stretch in there So what Im.going to do is just allow my head and my shoulders to go all.the way down towards the floor Im going to straighten my arms.out like this straight at the elbow Hands are going to.overlap and then Im going to lower my hands down towards the.floor as much as I can The more that you lower this down.the more that youre going to feel that spot over the can in.the upper back really start to open Only go to your comfort.level but one weve had a very deep but comfortable stretch.What Im going to do from there is just wing my arms down just a.little bit like this This will offer a little bit more passive.stretch into the upper back and you might get it to.selfrelease I dont know if you just heard it on the.microphone right there but I did get a little bit of a.release but just go very comfortably Dont try to force.anything If its going to go it will go but you can do this.one right here for about five repetitions Just switch over.different spots as needed and I do hope that that one right,"This video, I'm going to show you how to self-release your.upper back for instant pain relief Stay tuned.Hey, everyone Dr Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St.Joseph, Michigan If you're dealing with a tight, locked.up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self.release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not.going to want to miss I'm going to go over different.exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back.and give quick relief, even in as little as 30 seconds As a.side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments They.don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments.They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a.satisfying pop, crack, or release So, let's get started.and get the upper back feeling better Right now So, here is.an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in.the morning or before you go to bed at night I'm going to lay.flat on my back just like this Let's take our hands, place.them behind our head for a little bit of support What I'm.gonna do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head.right off the edge of the bed We want to focus on just.letting gravity take our body weight So, it's just taking my.head and shoulders and arms downwards like The more that.you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch.over the area where your upper back is placed over the bed.So, you want to go down as far as you're able to go just.letting gravity take it From there, what I do is wing my.elbows down just a little bit and then push down with my.head This will create a passive stretch into the upper.back and if it is locked up, you may feel it go pop, click,.or crack Again, that is just gases being released from the.joints You want to hold this about five seconds you're just.going to relax take a breather and then you're going to repeat.so just press down a little bit more with this next repetition.to open up the back just a little bit more but you can do.this for about three to 5 repetitions from there I just.slide down a little bit and then repeat pretty much all the.way from the upper back to the middle back with this one too.the further that you go down the more that you're going to.be able to go downwards like this so only go to your comfort.level if you do find that one particular spot is the spot.that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right.over that spot and then at this point, what we're going to do.is wing the elbows down like this We're going to push down.with the head to create that passive traction and hopefully,.this will get it to release If it doesn't, you can put a.little bit more passive stretch in there by just quickly.winging the elbows down just a little bit and I don't know if.you heard it over the microphone but I got a very.good release into my upper back right there but this is a good.way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding.up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that.need it the most So, here is a great upper back opener that.you can do at the edge of a bed You can also use the.armrest of a couch, a desk, or a chair It just needs to be.flat and elevated We're also going to start off on our.knees So, make sure to put a pillow or towel underneath them.for extra comfort Let's go right up to that flat elevated.surface I'm going to bend the arm like this and place the.backside of my arms flat on that elevated surface Let's.press down a little bit too just to create a stable anchor.point My hand they're going to go on my upper back right.across the shoulders just like this From here, I'm going to.tuck my chin towards my chest The movement is very easy I'm.just going to simply lower my body weight Kinda like taking.my butt down towards my heels Also, during this, I'm going to.let my chest go towards the edge of that flat elevated.surface as much as we can The more that you go down, the more.that you're going to feel a good stretch happening into the.upper back that goes all the way down to the middle and.lower back So, it usually feels really and if there is a.segment that's locked up, this will help open it up through.kind of a decompression traction pull but go down as.far as you're able to go Once you feel that comfortable.stretch, let's hold this for 20 seconds Do nice, slow,.controlled breathing also Let that tension out The more you.relax, the more results that you're gonna get with this.From there, I'm just going to relax, come back up, take a.breather, and then repeat this up to five times With each.repetition, go down just a little bit more Stretch into.it, challenge those muscles to open Up those joints and if it.is locked up, you might get a sudden pop crack or self.release With this one too, what I'm going to do is then.take it to the next level by just angling my body out a.little bit towards one side So, in this case, I'm going a.little bit towards my right I'm going to repeat this What.you're going to notice is it opens the back up just a little.bit differently So, experiment with different angles Go all.the way towards the right and then go all the way towards the.left If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot.like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw.more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most.So, here's an upper back self-release exercise that you.can pretty much do anywhere The only thing that we need is.a corner of a wall or a door I'm going to show two parts to.this because they're going to target two different locations.The first part, we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that.a lot of people get pain which is right here at the base of.the neck into the upper back across the shoulders This is.known as an upper trapezius stretch Very easy to do When.I go to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees, and then.slide it across my lower back as much as I can You'll feel.this muscle right up here start to relax That's the trapezius.muscle From there, I'm going to take my hand, place it on.the side right here, and then I'm just going to take my ear.towards the shoulder, the other side shoulder When you do.this, you'll really feel it open up into the neck right.here and a lot of times you'll get a sudden pop, crack, or.release into the neck or into the upper back It usually.feels really good Again, with this one, don't try to sit You.want to hold this one for about 15 to 20 seconds You're just.going to relax and then on the next repetition, drive the arm.over a little bit more and then take the ear down towards the.shoulder even more Get a better stretch each time And I.would do this on both sides to keep them in balance To focus.a little bit more down into the upper back and middle backs,.let's go right up here and do what I like to call the Y.stretch So, I'm going to put my arms up just like this to.the point where I can then lean into it like this So, I'm.putting my Y or my arms into a Y My feet go together and then.I'm just using my body weight to lean forward towards the.corner of that wall This feels really good You'll feel the.stretch into the chest but you'll also feel the shoulder.blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back You.may feel again a sudden pop or release Hold this for about 20.seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five.times You can also try different variations So,.instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call.the field goal and then do the same thing You'll notice that.it just open up the back just a little bit differently From.there, you can also go into a W but go through all three.motions I don't know if you just heard it over the.microphone but I got a pretty good release right there and I.just try to do all three motions, three to five.repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into.it and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release So,.here's what is known as an upper back corkscrew stretch.and it's a very good upper back opener because we can do a.little bit of rotation in there to get those joints moving.This one is done at the edge of the bed but you can also do.this one on the floor What I'm going to do is start with one.leg straight Usually the leg is closest towards the edge of.the bed and then the other side, what I'm gonna do is bend.the knee and then keep the foot flat I'm just going to press.into the side of my calf right here with that foot and press.down for stable anchor point Let's take the hand that's.closest towards the edge of the bed, grab onto the edge just.for a little bit more support What I'm going to do from there is.bend the other side's arms So, in this case, I'm gonna take my.right elbow and I weigh place it on the inside of my right.knee from there I'm going to press into it already you.should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back.a very good rotation because we're going towards the left.from here what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then.just turn my upper body to look away from me so kinda like.rotating a little bit towards my left the more that you turn.like this the more it's going to open up the back and you.might get a sudden pop crack or self release don't to force.this one just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is.going to go it will go but you want to hold this stretch for.about 20 seconds and it really feels good and then from there.I just relax take a breather and then I repeat this up to.five times with each repetition you can stretch into it just a.little bit more again don't try to force anything and then when.you're done on one side always switch to the other to keep.them both in balance my personal favorite way to self.release the upper back is with an extension exercise that you.can do on the floor The easiest way to do this exercise.is with a foam roller I know a lot of people don't have foam.rollers so I want to give different options.Surprisingly, using an extra large athletic or sports cup.really contours to the shape of the back and works very well.You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis.balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it, and tied it That.way, you can put the spine directly in between the two.balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise but.I'd like to keep things simple I'm going to be using my trusty.can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel.over the can of soup or the sports cup The other two, you.don't need a towel So, for demonstrated purposes, I will.be using my can of soup So, if you are using the soup can,.just place it in the middle of a large bath towel just like.this and then roll it up and you kinda have a homemade foam.roller From there, I'm just going to position it right on.the upper back So, I just go like this and it's pretty much.sent right over the spine itself What I can do from.there is just take my hands, place them on the back of the.head just like this and then just simply use my legs to roll.up and down from the middle to upper back We don't want to do.this one on the lower back because that can cause.irritation But just roll up and down, just allowing gravity.to take your shoulders, elbows, and head down just like this.and with this rolling motion, you might get a sudden pop.crack or self release but you can do this one nice and slow.up and down for about five to 10 complete repetitions If you.do use the athletic cup, you probably won't be able to do.this certain step but you should be able to do the.others So, let's say that you have one spot that just will.not release It's really tight, achy, and painful It needs a.little bit more tension Let's stop right over that spot From.there, what I'm going to do is just allow gravity to take my.head, my shoulders, and elbows down towards the floor as much.as we can Really put the back into a backwards extension just.like this and then from there, I'm going to plant my feet on.the floor and then lift my butt up Kinda like creating a.bridge-like exercise This time, what's going to happen is.that your upper body weight is going to drive down into the.can into the floor and it really intensifies the stretch.It feels really, really good for me and if that joint is.locked up, this might get it to self release but you can hold.this position for 15 to 20 seconds If it feels good, hold.it for longer You can hold it upwards towards a minute but.when you need a breather, just lower your butt down like this.and then repeat it about three to five times from there you.can just switch over different spots as needed if it still.feels like it does not want to release what we can do from.there is incorporate a little bit more dynamic movement so.this time around what I'm going to do is take my arms off like.this create like a field goal position with my arms let my.head go down towards the floor and then just wing the elbows.down towards the floor what this will do is it stretches.the chest opens the pack up just a little bit differently.and might get it to finally self release or pop but.challenge yourself to bring the elbows down as much as you can.You can hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds, relax, and then.repeat You can also do what are known as floor angels So,.go down all the way right here Lower the hands down towards or.I should say the back side are going to be towards the floor.and then from there, I'm going to wing my elbows down as much.as I can and then just raise my arms overhead just like this.You'll feel the again, the muscles just get hit a little.bit differently and that might just help If you feel like.it's still needs a little bit more tension, you can put a.little bit more of a passive stretch in there So, what I'm.going to do is just allow my head and my shoulders to go all.the way down towards the floor I'm going to straighten my arms.out like this straight at the elbow Hands are going to.overlap and then, I'm going to lower my hands down towards the.floor as much as I can The more that you lower this down,.the more that you're going to feel that spot over the can in.the upper back really start to open Only go to your comfort.level but one we've had a very deep but comfortable stretch.What I'm going to do from there is just wing my arms down just a.little bit like this This will offer a little bit more passive.stretch into the upper back and you might get it to.self-release I don't know if you just heard it on the.microphone right there but I did get a little bit of a.release but just go very comfortably Don't try to force.anything If it's going to go, it will go but you can do this.one right here for about five repetitions Just switch over.different spots as needed and I do hope that that one right.there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain.relief If the exercise is helped, please support the.channel by giving this video a like and maybe subscribing

movement what im going to do is im.going to take my butt.towards my heels just like this with.very good.straight posture and when i do this the.further that i go down towards the heels.youre going to feel.a very good traction stretch starting in.the upper back.that works its way down if its tight.enough you might feel it go all the way.down to the tailbone.go as far as you feel comfortable once.you hit that point.try to hold this for 15 seconds but you.can hold it longer.up to a half minute as long as you feel.comfortable.from there come back up take a bit of a.breather.and then just simply repeat this process.up to.five times each time you do it try to go.a little bit further with it.challenge yourself because its going to.intensify that stretch.and just get everything moving

michigan so if you're.looking for daily back stretches that.are pretty much going to hit.everything from the shoulders all the.way down to the tailbone this is a video.that you're not going to want to miss.we're going to go over easy safe and.effective.dynamic stretches that are going to help.pretty much target everything in the.back that you need.we're going to go over the muscles that.are most commonly associated with a lot.of back pain.a lot of back tightness stiffness those.type of things again.these are very good at just getting.everything moving and it's going to hit.so much in such a little amount of time.as a bonus all of these exercises can be.done at home and don't require any.special pieces of equipment.so let's get started with it and get the.back feeling better right now so with.these back stretches and exercises let's.start at the top and work our way down.towards the lower back.the first one is a modified yoga pose.called the child's pose but we're going.to do a little bit of a spin on there.what i want to do is start off on the.knees so make sure that you have a towel.or a pillow underneath for comfort and.we need a flat surface that's going to.be.a little bit elevated you can use a bed.a couch.if you're a desk worker you can use your.desk but what i'm going to do.is i'm going to bend the elbows at 90.degrees and put the back side of the.arms.just like this on that flat surface what.i'm going to do next is take the palms.right here.and then i'm going to reach behind me.and place them on the top of the.shoulders.really try to take the fingers down as.much as you can grab at the upper back.this helps stabilize this movement from.there i'm going to.tuck my chin towards my chest so this is.the movement what i'm going to do is i'm.going to take my butt.towards my heels just like this with.very good.straight posture and when i do this the.further that i go down towards the heels.you're going to feel.a very good traction stretch starting in.the upper back.that works its way down if it's tight.enough you might feel it go all the way.down to the tailbone.go as far as you feel comfortable once.you hit that point.try to hold this for 15 seconds but you.can hold it longer.up to a half minute as long as you feel.comfortable.from there come back up take a bit of a.breather.and then just simply repeat this process.up to.five times each time you do it try to go.a little bit further with it.challenge yourself because it's going to.intensify that stretch.and just get everything moving and.loosened up.so one of the biggest areas of complaint.for back tightness back pain achiness.you name it is.in between the shoulder blades so this.is one of my personal favorite ways to.really hit the rhomboid muscles.and everything in between the shoulder.blades let's go next to a wall.we're going to place one side of our.body that's facing the wall.completely flush against it from the.ankle knee hip to the shoulder right.here.i'm going to take the arm that is.closest to the wall.and also go flush with it and have it go.straight like this.at the elbow let's take the other hand.and the other arm go straight with it.and go directly over it like we're going.to be able to clap.next let's make sure that we don't have.any pelvic tilt so let's have very good.upright posture.and then from there what i'm going to do.is i'm going to take my upper body.and i'm going to lean forward at the.shoulders almost like i'm rounding my.back but i'm reaching forward with my.hands.when you do this you're going to feel.the shoulder blades.start to open up in the back it's going.to help stretch those rhomboids those.muscles in between those shoulder blades.go as far as you feel comfortable when.you hit that spot.hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five times.this is how we can take it to the next.level let's go back into that starting.position just like this.but what i'm going to do is with the uh.hand in the arm that is facing away from.the wall.let's take it out straight and then i'm.going to turn my body like this.and try to take the hand towards the.opposite.side of the wall over here and when you.do this you're going to feel a great.stretch.into the chest and also into the upper.back thoracic.area hold this for 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back.relax take a breather and then just.repeat this.up to five times for the lower back one.of the best.mobility stretches is the corkscrew and.it's a personal favorite for many people.because.it works so well that you might get a.pop snap or crack.in the back while doing it you want to.do this one.in bed so what i'm going to do is i'm.going to go to.the edge of a bed i'm going to then take.my legs place them flat.the leg that is facing away from the.edge let's.bend that one up like this and then lift.the knee up to where it's 90 degrees at.the knee like this.let's take the hand that is facing.towards the edge of the bed.and grab on the outside of that knee.that is bent.from there what i'm going to do is i'm.going to rotate this knee right here.over the edge of the bed and when you do.this you're going to start to feel a.very very good stretch.into the lower back you want to keep.taking that knee down.until you feel a great stretch sometimes.you do get a pop or a crack it's just.gas is being released from the lower.back what you want to do is you want to.hold this position for about five.seconds the next part let's take the arm.that is facing away from the edge of the.bed.and then what i'm going to do is i'm.going to take it towards the opposite.direction and i'm also going to look in.that direction you're going to.notice that this intensifies that.stretch.into the lower back but it will also.stretch into the upper back.only go to your comfort level hold this.for about 15 seconds.you're just going to relax and then.you're just going to repeat this.up to five times so this next one is.going to focus a little bit more into.the lower back especially around the.belt line into the glutes buttock.and the piriformis muscle you just need.a flat surface the edge of a bed.works perfectly what i'm going to do is.whatever side that i'm focusing on.let's take that side's leg like this.and go like this this is known as a.modified pigeon pose it's.also known as a figure four what i want.to do is position.my leg to where the knee is at 90.degrees from the ankle knee to the.hip and it's also a straight line for my.knee all the way to the hip right here.you should almost be able to put.all your weight right through here the.other leg is going to go straight.what i need to do from there is make.sure that we have good upright posture.and i'm just going to just simply cross.my arms over like.this and i'm going to lean forward into.it and when we do this we don't want to.round our back into it we want to keep.it nice and straight and.pivot from the hips just like this and.when you do it you're going to feel a.great stretch into the lower back.the glute the buttock and also into the.piriformis muscle.only go to your comfort level try to.hold this for about 15 seconds.from there you're going to relax and.then repeat up to.five times this is how we're going to.take it to the next level and.incorporate a lot of motion in there to.really target that muscle.i'm going to go back into that leaning.forward position but what i'm going to.do next is i'm going to then.rotate my body all the way over to one.certain direction in this case it's.going to be.to the right and i'm going to repeat.that you're going to notice that this.hits that muscle just a little bit.differently.go into it as far as you feel.comfortable come back up.and then you're going to turn and you're.going to just simply do that.and you want to do this pretty much all.the way from one.direction all the way to the next.so i'm going to rotate all the way over.towards my left.you're going to notice that one certain.angle one certain spot let's say right.here.hits it a little bit more than the.others.make note of that and try to do a couple.more repetitions in there because it's.going to target that muscle.and really hopefully yeah loosen it up.from there you always want to switch to.the other side to make sure.both sides are kept in balance so a huge.instigator of back issues are.tight hip flexors they can cause lower.back pelvic and.hip pain what i'm going to be doing is a.3d hip flexor stretch that's going to.hit the muscles in.so many different directions and can.give very good relief.for those tight hip flexors i'm going to.be using a sturdy.foldable chair made famous in wrestling.what i'm going to do just simply bend.one leg at 90 degrees like this so the.knee is at 90 degrees the other one off.the chair is going to be completely.straight.let's take our hands let's place them.off to the sides of the hip.from there let's make sure that we have.good upright posture.and make sure to have no pelvic tilt i'm.going to do a lunging position.just like this so let's lean into it the.more that you lunge forward into it the.more you're going to feel a.great stretch in the front of the leg.that is off the chair the one that is.straight that is stretching those hip.flexors.you're also going to feel a good stretch.into the legs the butt lower back.on the opposite side try to hold this.one for 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and then.you're going to repeat this.up to five times each time go a little.bit further with it to challenge those.muscles.this is how we're going to take this to.the next level let's.take our arms cross them over like this.go back into that lunging position.but let's turn towards one direction so.in this case i'm turning all the way.towards my right.and when you do this you're going to.notice that the back muscles the glute.buttock and the leg muscles are hit.just a little bit differently hold this.for 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and then.you're just going to repeat this again.up to five times going a little bit.further once you've done one side.just simply go to the other side and.again notice how that hits those muscles.just a little bit differently.you want to do 15 second holds five.times on the opposite side.so this is how we can take it even to.the next level from there.let me move the chair so you can see.this just a little bit more what we're.going to do.is more of a lateral side bend stretch.that's also going to hit a.main muscle in the back that is the ql.or quadratus lumborum.let's go back into that lunging position.just like this.but let's take the arms go completely.straight and put them over our heads.i'm going to do a lateral bend that is.just turning my body towards one certain.direction.and when you do this you're going to.feel a great stretch i feel it from my.armpit.all the way down to my hip you want to.keep just bending over as far as you're.able to go.hold this for up to 15 seconds you're.just going to relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five.times from there do the same thing but.then go towards the opposite direction.and when you do all of these make sure.to then switch to the other side.and repeat because you want to keep.everything balanced on both.sides so if you liked the video and got.a lot of relief please show us your.support by giving this video like and.maybe subscribing to our channel too if.you have any comments or questions.please leave them below i'll get

44eYerscDWk,How to do stretching to help rhomboid muscles stiffness?,"(171, 266)",is one of my personal favorite ways to.really hit the rhomboid muscles.and everything in between the shoulder.blades lets go next to a wall.were going to place one side of our.body thats facing the wall.completely flush against it from the.ankle knee hip to the shoulder right.here.im going to take the arm that is.closest to the wall.and also go flush with it and have it go.straight like this.at the elbow lets take the other hand.and the other arm go straight with it.and go directly over it like were going.to be able to clap.next lets make sure that we dont have.any pelvic tilt so lets have very good.upright posture.and then from there what im going to do.is im going to take my upper body.and im going to lean forward at the.shoulders almost like im rounding my.back but im reaching forward with my.hands.when you do this youre going to feel.the shoulder blades.start to open up in the back its going.to help stretch those rhomboids those.muscles in between those shoulder blades.go as far as you feel comfortable when.you hit that spot.hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds.youre just going to come back and relax.and then youre going to repeat this up.to five times.this is how we can take it to the next.level lets go back into that starting.position just like this.but what im going to do is with the uh.hand in the arm that is facing away from.the wall.lets take it out straight and then im.going to turn my body like this.and try to take the hand towards the.opposite.side of the wall over here and when you.do this youre going to feel a great.stretch.into the chest and also into the upper.back thoracic.area hold this for 10 to 15 seconds.youre just going to come back.relax take a breather and then just.repeat this.up to five times for the lower back one,in this video i'm going to show you the.best full back stretching exercises that.you can do at home.using no equipment stay tuned.hey everyone dr rowe from spike here in.saint joseph michigan so if you're.looking for daily back stretches that.are pretty much going to hit.everything from the shoulders all the.way down to the tailbone this is a video.that you're not going to want to miss.we're going to go over easy safe and.effective.dynamic stretches that are going to help.pretty much target everything in the.back that you need.we're going to go over the muscles that.are most commonly associated with a lot.of back pain.a lot of back tightness stiffness those.type of things again.these are very good at just getting.everything moving and it's going to hit.so much in such a little amount of time.as a bonus all of these exercises can be.done at home and don't require any.special pieces of equipment.so let's get started with it and get the.back feeling better right now so with.these back stretches and exercises let's.start at the top and work our way down.towards the lower back.the first one is a modified yoga pose.called the child's pose but we're going.to do a little bit of a spin on there.what i want to do is start off on the.knees so make sure that you have a towel.or a pillow underneath for comfort and.we need a flat surface that's going to.be.a little bit elevated you can use a bed.a couch.if you're a desk worker you can use your.desk but what i'm going to do.is i'm going to bend the elbows at 90.degrees and put the back side of the.arms.just like this on that flat surface what.i'm going to do next is take the palms.right here.and then i'm going to reach behind me.and place them on the top of the.shoulders.really try to take the fingers down as.much as you can grab at the upper back.this helps stabilize this movement from.there i'm going to.tuck my chin towards my chest so this is.the movement what i'm going to do is i'm.going to take my butt.towards my heels just like this with.very good.straight posture and when i do this the.further that i go down towards the heels.you're going to feel.a very good traction stretch starting in.the upper back.that works its way down if it's tight.enough you might feel it go all the way.down to the tailbone.go as far as you feel comfortable once.you hit that point.try to hold this for 15 seconds but you.can hold it longer.up to a half minute as long as you feel.comfortable.from there come back up take a bit of a.breather.and then just simply repeat this process.up to.five times each time you do it try to go.a little bit further with it.challenge yourself because it's going to.intensify that stretch.and just get everything moving and.loosened up.so one of the biggest areas of complaint.for back tightness back pain achiness.you name it is.in between the shoulder blades so this.is one of my personal favorite ways to.really hit the rhomboid muscles.and everything in between the shoulder.blades let's go next to a wall.we're going to place one side of our.body that's facing the wall.completely flush against it from the.ankle knee hip to the shoulder right.here.i'm going to take the arm that is.closest to the wall.and also go flush with it and have it go.straight like this.at the elbow let's take the other hand.and the other arm go straight with it.and go directly over it like we're going.to be able to clap.next let's make sure that we don't have.any pelvic tilt so let's have very good.upright posture.and then from there what i'm going to do.is i'm going to take my upper body.and i'm going to lean forward at the.shoulders almost like i'm rounding my.back but i'm reaching forward with my.hands.when you do this you're going to feel.the shoulder blades.start to open up in the back it's going.to help stretch those rhomboids those.muscles in between those shoulder blades.go as far as you feel comfortable when.you hit that spot.hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five times.this is how we can take it to the next.level let's go back into that starting.position just like this.but what i'm going to do is with the uh.hand in the arm that is facing away from.the wall.let's take it out straight and then i'm.going to turn my body like this.and try to take the hand towards the.opposite.side of the wall over here and when you.do this you're going to feel a great.stretch.into the chest and also into the upper.back thoracic.area hold this for 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back.relax take a breather and then just.repeat this.up to five times for the lower back one.of the best.mobility stretches is the corkscrew and.it's a personal favorite for many people.because.it works so well that you might get a.pop snap or crack.in the back while doing it you want to.do this one.in bed so what i'm going to do is i'm.going to go to.the edge of a bed i'm going to then take.my legs place them flat.the leg that is facing away from the.edge let's.bend that one up like this and then lift.the knee up to where it's 90 degrees at.the knee like this.let's take the hand that is facing.towards the edge of the bed.and grab on the outside of that knee.that is bent.from there what i'm going to do is i'm.going to rotate this knee right here.over the edge of the bed and when you do.this you're going to start to feel a.very very good stretch.into the lower back you want to keep.taking that knee down.until you feel a great stretch sometimes.you do get a pop or a crack it's just.gas is being released from the lower.back what you want to do is you want to.hold this position for about five.seconds the next part let's take the arm.that is facing away from the edge of the.bed.and then what i'm going to do is i'm.going to take it towards the opposite.direction and i'm also going to look in.that direction you're going to.notice that this intensifies that.stretch.into the lower back but it will also.stretch into the upper back.only go to your comfort level hold this.for about 15 seconds.you're just going to relax and then.you're just going to repeat this.up to five times so this next one is.going to focus a little bit more into.the lower back especially around the.belt line into the glutes buttock.and the piriformis muscle you just need.a flat surface the edge of a bed.works perfectly what i'm going to do is.whatever side that i'm focusing on.let's take that side's leg like this.and go like this this is known as a.modified pigeon pose it's.also known as a figure four what i want.to do is position.my leg to where the knee is at 90.degrees from the ankle knee to the.hip and it's also a straight line for my.knee all the way to the hip right here.you should almost be able to put.all your weight right through here the.other leg is going to go straight.what i need to do from there is make.sure that we have good upright posture.and i'm just going to just simply cross.my arms over like.this and i'm going to lean forward into.it and when we do this we don't want to.round our back into it we want to keep.it nice and straight and.pivot from the hips just like this and.when you do it you're going to feel a.great stretch into the lower back.the glute the buttock and also into the.piriformis muscle.only go to your comfort level try to.hold this for about 15 seconds.from there you're going to relax and.then repeat up to.five times this is how we're going to.take it to the next level and.incorporate a lot of motion in there to.really target that muscle.i'm going to go back into that leaning.forward position but what i'm going to.do next is i'm going to then.rotate my body all the way over to one.certain direction in this case it's.going to be.to the right and i'm going to repeat.that you're going to notice that this.hits that muscle just a little bit.differently.go into it as far as you feel.comfortable come back up.and then you're going to turn and you're.going to just simply do that.and you want to do this pretty much all.the way from one.direction all the way to the next.so i'm going to rotate all the way over.towards my left.you're going to notice that one certain.angle one certain spot let's say right.here.hits it a little bit more than the.others.make note of that and try to do a couple.more repetitions in there because it's.going to target that muscle.and really hopefully yeah loosen it up.from there you always want to switch to.the other side to make sure.both sides are kept in balance so a huge.instigator of back issues are.tight hip flexors they can cause lower.back pelvic and.hip pain what i'm going to be doing is a.3d hip flexor stretch that's going to.hit the muscles in.so many different directions and can.give very good relief.for those tight hip flexors i'm going to.be using a sturdy.foldable chair made famous in wrestling.what i'm going to do just simply bend.one leg at 90 degrees like this so the.knee is at 90 degrees the other one off.the chair is going to be completely.straight.let's take our hands let's place them.off to the sides of the hip.from there let's make sure that we have.good upright posture.and make sure to have no pelvic tilt i'm.going to do a lunging position.just like this so let's lean into it the.more that you lunge forward into it the.more you're going to feel a.great stretch in the front of the leg.that is off the chair the one that is.straight that is stretching those hip.flexors.you're also going to feel a good stretch.into the legs the butt lower back.on the opposite side try to hold this.one for 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and then.you're going to repeat this.up to five times each time go a little.bit further with it to challenge those.muscles.this is how we're going to take this to.the next level let's.take our arms cross them over like this.go back into that lunging position.but let's turn towards one direction so.in this case i'm turning all the way.towards my right.and when you do this you're going to.notice that the back muscles the glute.buttock and the leg muscles are hit.just a little bit differently hold this.for 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and then.you're just going to repeat this again.up to five times going a little bit.further once you've done one side.just simply go to the other side and.again notice how that hits those muscles.just a little bit differently.you want to do 15 second holds five.times on the opposite side.so this is how we can take it even to.the next level from there.let me move the chair so you can see.this just a little bit more what we're.going to do.is more of a lateral side bend stretch.that's also going to hit a.main muscle in the back that is the ql.or quadratus lumborum.let's go back into that lunging position.just like this.but let's take the arms go completely.straight and put them over our heads.i'm going to do a lateral bend that is.just turning my body towards one certain.direction.and when you do this you're going to.feel a great stretch i feel it from my.armpit.all the way down to my hip you want to.keep just bending over as far as you're.able to go.hold this for up to 15 seconds you're.just going to relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five.times from there do the same thing but.then go towards the opposite direction.and when you do all of these make sure.to then switch to the other side.and repeat because you want to keep.everything balanced on both.sides so if you liked the video and got.a lot of relief please show us your.support by giving this video like and.maybe subscribing to our channel too if.you have

44eYerscDWk,How to do corkscrew mobility stretches to help with back tightness stiffness?,"(273, 360)",mobility stretches is the corkscrew and.its a personal favorite for many people.because.it works so well that you might get a.pop snap or crack.in the back while doing it you want to.do this one.in bed so what im going to do is im.going to go to.the edge of a bed im going to then take.my legs place them flat.the leg that is facing away from the.edge lets.bend that one up like this and then lift.the knee up to where its 90 degrees at.the knee like this.lets take the hand that is facing.towards the edge of the bed.and grab on the outside of that knee.that is bent.from there what im going to do is im.going to rotate this knee right here.over the edge of the bed and when you do.this youre going to start to feel a.very very good stretch.into the lower back you want to keep.taking that knee down.until you feel a great stretch sometimes.you do get a pop or a crack its just.gas is being released from the lower.back what you want to do is you want to.hold this position for about five.seconds the next part lets take the arm.that is facing away from the edge of the.bed.and then what im going to do is im.going to take it towards the opposite.direction and im also going to look in.that direction youre going to.notice that this intensifies that.stretch.into the lower back but it will also.stretch into the upper back.only go to your comfort level hold this.for about 15 seconds.youre just going to relax and then.youre just going to repeat this.up to five times so this next one is,in this video i'm going to show you the.best full back stretching exercises that.you can do at home.using no equipment stay tuned.hey everyone dr rowe from spike here in.saint joseph michigan so if you're.looking for daily back stretches that.are pretty much going to hit.everything from the shoulders all the.way down to the tailbone this is a video.that you're not going to want to miss.we're going to go over easy safe and.effective.dynamic stretches that are going to help.pretty much target everything in the.back that you need.we're going to go over the muscles that.are most commonly associated with a lot.of back pain.a lot of back tightness stiffness those.type of things again.these are very good at just getting.everything moving and it's going to hit.so much in such a little amount of time.as a bonus all of these exercises can be.done at home and don't require any.special pieces of equipment.so let's get started with it and get the.back feeling better right now so with.these back stretches and exercises let's.start at the top and work our way down.towards the lower back.the first one is a modified yoga pose.called the child's pose but we're going.to do a little bit of a spin on there.what i want to do is start off on the.knees so make sure that you have a towel.or a pillow underneath for comfort and.we need a flat surface that's going to.be.a little bit elevated you can use a bed.a couch.if you're a desk worker you can use your.desk but what i'm going to do.is i'm going to bend the elbows at 90.degrees and put the back side of the.arms.just like this on that flat surface what.i'm going to do next is take the palms.right here.and then i'm going to reach behind me.and place them on the top of the.shoulders.really try to take the fingers down as.much as you can grab at the upper back.this helps stabilize this movement from.there i'm going to.tuck my chin towards my chest so this is.the movement what i'm going to do is i'm.going to take my butt.towards my heels just like this with.very good.straight posture and when i do this the.further that i go down towards the heels.you're going to feel.a very good traction stretch starting in.the upper back.that works its way down if it's tight.enough you might feel it go all the way.down to the tailbone.go as far as you feel comfortable once.you hit that point.try to hold this for 15 seconds but you.can hold it longer.up to a half minute as long as you feel.comfortable.from there come back up take a bit of a.breather.and then just simply repeat this process.up to.five times each time you do it try to go.a little bit further with it.challenge yourself because it's going to.intensify that stretch.and just get everything moving and.loosened up.so one of the biggest areas of complaint.for back tightness back pain achiness.you name it is.in between the shoulder blades so this.is one of my personal favorite ways to.really hit the rhomboid muscles.and everything in between the shoulder.blades let's go next to a wall.we're going to place one side of our.body that's facing the wall.completely flush against it from the.ankle knee hip to the shoulder right.here.i'm going to take the arm that is.closest to the wall.and also go flush with it and have it go.straight like this.at the elbow let's take the other hand.and the other arm go straight with it.and go directly over it like we're going.to be able to clap.next let's make sure that we don't have.any pelvic tilt so let's have very good.upright posture.and then from there what i'm going to do.is i'm going to take my upper body.and i'm going to lean forward at the.shoulders almost like i'm rounding my.back but i'm reaching forward with my.hands.when you do this you're going to feel.the shoulder blades.start to open up in the back it's going.to help stretch those rhomboids those.muscles in between those shoulder blades.go as far as you feel comfortable when.you hit that spot.hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five times.this is how we can take it to the next.level let's go back into that starting.position just like this.but what i'm going to do is with the uh.hand in the arm that is facing away from.the wall.let's take it out straight and then i'm.going to turn my body like this.and try to take the hand towards the.opposite.side of the wall over here and when you.do this you're going to feel a great.stretch.into the chest and also into the upper.back thoracic.area hold this for 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back.relax take a breather and then just.repeat this.up to five times for the lower back one.of the best.mobility stretches is the corkscrew and.it's a personal favorite for many people.because.it works so well that you might get a.pop snap or crack.in the back while doing it you want to.do this one.in bed so what i'm going to do is i'm.going to go to.the edge of a bed i'm going to then take.my legs place them flat.the leg that is facing away from the.edge let's.bend that one up like this and then lift.the knee up to where it's 90 degrees at.the knee like this.let's take the hand that is facing.towards the edge of the bed.and grab on the outside of that knee.that is bent.from there what i'm going to do is i'm.going to rotate this knee right here.over the edge of the bed and when you do.this you're going to start to feel a.very very good stretch.into the lower back you want to keep.taking that knee down.until you feel a great stretch sometimes.you do get a pop or a crack it's just.gas is being released from the lower.back what you want to do is you want to.hold this position for about five.seconds the next part let's take the arm.that is facing away from the edge of the.bed.and then what i'm going to do is i'm.going to take it towards the opposite.direction and i'm also going to look in.that direction you're going to.notice that this intensifies that.stretch.into the lower back but it will also.stretch into the upper back.only go to your comfort level hold this.for about 15 seconds.you're just going to relax and then.you're just going to repeat this.up to five times so this next one is.going to focus a little bit more into.the lower back especially around the.belt line into the glutes buttock.and the piriformis muscle you just need.a flat surface the edge of a bed.works perfectly what i'm going to do is.whatever side that i'm focusing on.let's take that side's leg like this.and go like this this is known as a.modified pigeon pose it's.also known as a figure four what i want.to do is position.my leg to where the knee is at 90.degrees from the ankle knee to the.hip and it's also a straight line for my.knee all the way to the hip right here.you should almost be able to put.all your weight right through here the.other leg is going to go straight.what i need to do from there is make.sure that we have good upright posture.and i'm just going to just simply cross.my arms over like.this and i'm going to lean forward into.it and when we do this we don't want to.round our back into it we want to keep.it nice and straight and.pivot from the hips just like this and.when you do it you're going to feel a.great stretch into the lower back.the glute the buttock and also into the.piriformis muscle.only go to your comfort level try to.hold this for about 15 seconds.from there you're going to relax and.then repeat up to.five times this is how we're going to.take it to the next level and.incorporate a lot of motion in there to.really target that muscle.i'm going to go back into that leaning.forward position but what i'm going to.do next is i'm going to then.rotate my body all the way over to one.certain direction in this case it's.going to be.to the right and i'm going to repeat.that you're going to notice that this.hits that muscle just a little bit.differently.go into it as far as you feel.comfortable come back up.and then you're going to turn and you're.going to just simply do that.and you want to do this pretty much all.the way from one.direction all the way to the next.so i'm going to rotate all the way over.towards my left.you're going to notice that one certain.angle one certain spot let's say right.here.hits it a little bit more than the.others.make note of that and try to do a couple.more repetitions in there because it's.going to target that muscle.and really hopefully yeah loosen it up.from there you always want to switch to.the other side to make sure.both sides are kept in balance so a huge.instigator of back issues are.tight hip flexors they can cause lower.back pelvic and.hip pain what i'm going to be doing is a.3d hip flexor stretch that's going to.hit the muscles in.so many different directions and can.give very good relief.for those tight hip flexors i'm going to.be using a sturdy.foldable chair made famous in wrestling.what i'm going to do just simply bend.one leg at 90 degrees like this so the.knee is at 90 degrees the other one off.the chair is going to be completely.straight.let's take our hands let's place them.off to the sides of the hip.from there let's make sure that we have.good upright posture.and make sure to have no pelvic tilt i'm.going to do a lunging position.just like this so let's lean into it the.more that you lunge forward into it the.more you're going to feel a.great stretch in the front of the leg.that is off the chair the one that is.straight that is stretching those hip.flexors.you're also going to feel a good stretch.into the legs the butt lower back.on the opposite side try to hold this.one for 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and then.you're going to repeat this.up to five times each time go a little.bit further with it to challenge those.muscles.this is how we're going to take this to.the next level let's.take our arms cross them over like this.go back into that lunging position.but let's turn towards one direction so.in this case i'm turning all the way.towards my right.and when you do this you're going to.notice that the back muscles the glute.buttock and the leg muscles are hit.just a little bit differently hold this.for 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and then.you're just going to repeat this again.up to five times going a little bit.further once you've done one side.just simply go to the other side and.again notice how that hits those muscles.just a little bit differently.you want to do 15 second holds five.times on the opposite side.so this is how we can take it even to.the next level from there.let me move the chair so you can see.this just a little bit more what we're.going to do.is more of a lateral side bend stretch.that's also going to hit a.main muscle in the back that is the ql.or quadratus lumborum.let's go back into that lunging position.just like this.but let's take the arms go completely.straight and put them over our heads.i'm going to do a lateral bend that is.just turning my body towards one certain.direction.and when you do this you're going to.feel a great stretch i feel it from my.armpit.all the way down to my hip you want to.keep just bending over as far as you're.able to go.hold this for up to 15 seconds you're.just going to relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five.times from there do the same thing but.then go towards the opposite direction.and when you do all of these make sure.to then switch to the other side.and repeat because you want to keep.everything balanced on both.sides so if you liked

44eYerscDWk,How can I do modified pigeon pose stretching to help glutes buttock stiffness?,"(375, 495)",works perfectly what im going to do is.whatever side that im focusing on.lets take that sides leg like this.and go like this this is known as a.modified pigeon pose its.also known as a figure four what i want.to do is position.my leg to where the knee is at 90.degrees from the ankle knee to the.hip and its also a straight line for my.knee all the way to the hip right here.you should almost be able to put.all your weight right through here the.other leg is going to go straight.what i need to do from there is make.sure that we have good upright posture.and im just going to just simply cross.my arms over like.this and im going to lean forward into.it and when we do this we dont want to.round our back into it we want to keep.it nice and straight and.pivot from the hips just like this and.when you do it youre going to feel a.great stretch into the lower back.the glute the buttock and also into the.piriformis muscle.only go to your comfort level try to.hold this for about 15 seconds.from there youre going to relax and.then repeat up to.five times this is how were going to.take it to the next level and.incorporate a lot of motion in there to.really target that muscle.im going to go back into that leaning.forward position but what im going to.do next is im going to then.rotate my body all the way over to one.certain direction in this case its.going to be.to the right and im going to repeat.that youre going to notice that this.hits that muscle just a little bit.differently.go into it as far as you feel.comfortable come back up.and then youre going to turn and youre.going to just simply do that.and you want to do this pretty much all.the way from one.direction all the way to the next.so im going to rotate all the way over.towards my left.youre going to notice that one certain.angle one certain spot lets say right.here.hits it a little bit more than the.others.make note of that and try to do a couple.more repetitions in there because its.going to target that muscle.and really hopefully yeah loosen it up.from there you always want to switch to.the other side to make sure,in this video i'm going to show you the.best full back stretching exercises that.you can do at home.using no equipment stay tuned.hey everyone dr rowe from spike here in.saint joseph michigan so if you're.looking for daily back stretches that.are pretty much going to hit.everything from the shoulders all the.way down to the tailbone this is a video.that you're not going to want to miss.we're going to go over easy safe and.effective.dynamic stretches that are going to help.pretty much target everything in the.back that you need.we're going to go over the muscles that.are most commonly associated with a lot.of back pain.a lot of back tightness stiffness those.type of things again.these are very good at just getting.everything moving and it's going to hit.so much in such a little amount of time.as a bonus all of these exercises can be.done at home and don't require any.special pieces of equipment.so let's get started with it and get the.back feeling better right now so with.these back stretches and exercises let's.start at the top and work our way down.towards the lower back.the first one is a modified yoga pose.called the child's pose but we're going.to do a little bit of a spin on there.what i want to do is start off on the.knees so make sure that you have a towel.or a pillow underneath for comfort and.we need a flat surface that's going to.be.a little bit elevated you can use a bed.a couch.if you're a desk worker you can use your.desk but what i'm going to do.is i'm going to bend the elbows at 90.degrees and put the back side of the.arms.just like this on that flat surface what.i'm going to do next is take the palms.right here.and then i'm going to reach behind me.and place them on the top of the.shoulders.really try to take the fingers down as.much as you can grab at the upper back.this helps stabilize this movement from.there i'm going to.tuck my chin towards my chest so this is.the movement what i'm going to do is i'm.going to take my butt.towards my heels just like this with.very good.straight posture and when i do this the.further that i go down towards the heels.you're going to feel.a very good traction stretch starting in.the upper back.that works its way down if it's tight.enough you might feel it go all the way.down to the tailbone.go as far as you feel comfortable once.you hit that point.try to hold this for 15 seconds but you.can hold it longer.up to a half minute as long as you feel.comfortable.from there come back up take a bit of a.breather.and then just simply repeat this process.up to.five times each time you do it try to go.a little bit further with it.challenge yourself because it's going to.intensify that stretch.and just get everything moving and.loosened up.so one of the biggest areas of complaint.for back tightness back pain achiness.you name it is.in between the shoulder blades so this.is one of my personal favorite ways to.really hit the rhomboid muscles.and everything in between the shoulder.blades let's go next to a wall.we're going to place one side of our.body that's facing the wall.completely flush against it from the.ankle knee hip to the shoulder right.here.i'm going to take the arm that is.closest to the wall.and also go flush with it and have it go.straight like this.at the elbow let's take the other hand.and the other arm go straight with it.and go directly over it like we're going.to be able to clap.next let's make sure that we don't have.any pelvic tilt so let's have very good.upright posture.and then from there what i'm going to do.is i'm going to take my upper body.and i'm going to lean forward at the.shoulders almost like i'm rounding my.back but i'm reaching forward with my.hands.when you do this you're going to feel.the shoulder blades.start to open up in the back it's going.to help stretch those rhomboids those.muscles in between those shoulder blades.go as far as you feel comfortable when.you hit that spot.hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five times.this is how we can take it to the next.level let's go back into that starting.position just like this.but what i'm going to do is with the uh.hand in the arm that is facing away from.the wall.let's take it out straight and then i'm.going to turn my body like this.and try to take the hand towards the.opposite.side of the wall over here and when you.do this you're going to feel a great.stretch.into the chest and also into the upper.back thoracic.area hold this for 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back.relax take a breather and then just.repeat this.up to five times for the lower back one.of the best.mobility stretches is the corkscrew and.it's a personal favorite for many people.because.it works so well that you might get a.pop snap or crack.in the back while doing it you want to.do this one.in bed so what i'm going to do is i'm.going to go to.the edge of a bed i'm going to then take.my legs place them flat.the leg that is facing away from the.edge let's.bend that one up like this and then lift.the knee up to where it's 90 degrees at.the knee like this.let's take the hand that is facing.towards the edge of the bed.and grab on the outside of that knee.that is bent.from there what i'm going to do is i'm.going to rotate this knee right here.over the edge of the bed and when you do.this you're going to start to feel a.very very good stretch.into the lower back you want to keep.taking that knee down.until you feel a great stretch sometimes.you do get a pop or a crack it's just.gas is being released from the lower.back what you want to do is you want to.hold this position for about five.seconds the next part let's take the arm.that is facing away from the edge of the.bed.and then what i'm going to do is i'm.going to take it towards the opposite.direction and i'm also going to look in.that direction you're going to.notice that this intensifies that.stretch.into the lower back but it will also.stretch into the upper back.only go to your comfort level hold this.for about 15 seconds.you're just going to relax and then.you're just going to repeat this.up to five times so this next one is.going to focus a little bit more into.the lower back especially around the.belt line into the glutes buttock.and the piriformis muscle you just need.a flat surface the edge of a bed.works perfectly what i'm going to do is.whatever side that i'm focusing on.let's take that side's leg like this.and go like this this is known as a.modified pigeon pose it's.also known as a figure four what i want.to do is position.my leg to where the knee is at 90.degrees from the ankle knee to the.hip and it's also a straight line for my.knee all the way to the hip right here.you should almost be able to put.all your weight right through here the.other leg is going to go straight.what i need to do from there is make.sure that we have good upright posture.and i'm just going to just simply cross.my arms over like.this and i'm going to lean forward into.it and when we do this we don't want to.round our back into it we want to keep.it nice and straight and.pivot from the hips just like this and.when you do it you're going to feel a.great stretch into the lower back.the glute the buttock and also into the.piriformis muscle.only go to your comfort level try to.hold this for about 15 seconds.from there you're going to relax and.then repeat up to.five times this is how we're going to.take it to the next level and.incorporate a lot of motion in there to.really target that muscle.i'm going to go back into that leaning.forward position but what i'm going to.do next is i'm going to then.rotate my body all the way over to one.certain direction in this case it's.going to be.to the right and i'm going to repeat.that you're going to notice that this.hits that muscle just a little bit.differently.go into it as far as you feel.comfortable come back up.and then you're going to turn and you're.going to just simply do that.and you want to do this pretty much all.the way from one.direction all the way to the next.so i'm going to rotate all the way over.towards my left.you're going to notice that one certain.angle one certain spot let's say right.here.hits it a little bit more than the.others.make note of that and try to do a couple.more repetitions in there because it's.going to target that muscle.and really hopefully yeah loosen it up.from there you always want to switch to.the other side to make sure.both sides are kept in balance so a huge.instigator of back issues are.tight hip flexors they can cause lower.back pelvic and.hip pain what i'm going to be doing is a.3d hip flexor stretch that's going to.hit the muscles in.so many different directions and can.give very good relief.for those tight hip flexors i'm going to.be using a sturdy.foldable chair made famous in wrestling.what i'm going to do just simply bend.one leg at 90 degrees like this so the.knee is at 90 degrees the other one off.the chair is going to be completely.straight.let's take our hands let's place them.off to the sides of the hip.from there let's make sure that we have.good upright posture.and make sure to have no pelvic tilt i'm.going to do a lunging position.just like this so let's lean into it the.more that you lunge forward into it the.more you're going to feel a.great stretch in the front of the leg.that is off the chair the one that is.straight that is stretching those hip.flexors.you're also going to feel a good stretch.into the legs the butt lower back.on the opposite side try to hold this.one for 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and then.you're going to repeat this.up to five times each time go a little.bit further with it to challenge those.muscles.this is how we're going to take this to.the next level let's.take our arms cross them over like this.go back into that lunging position.but let's turn towards one direction so.in this case i'm turning all the way.towards my right.and when you do this you're going to.notice that the back muscles the glute.buttock and the leg muscles are hit.just a little bit differently hold this.for 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and then.you're just going to repeat this again.up to five times going a little bit.further once you've done one side.just simply go to the other side and.again notice how that hits those muscles.just a little bit differently.you want to do 15 second holds five.times on the opposite side.so this is how we can take it even to.the next level from there.let me move the chair so you can see.this just a little bit more what we're.going to do.is more of a lateral side bend stretch.that's also going to hit a.main muscle in the back that is the ql.or quadratus lumborum.let's go back into that lunging position.just like this.but let's take the arms go completely.straight and put them over our heads.i'm going to do a lateral bend that is.just turning my body towards one certain.direction.and when you do this you're going to.feel a great stretch i feel it from my.armpit.all the way down to my hip you want to.keep just bending over as far as you're.able to go.hold this for up to 15 seconds you're.just going to relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five.times from there do the same thing but.then go towards the opposite direction.and when you do all of these make sure.to then switch to the other side.and repeat because you want to keep.everything balanced on both.sides so if you liked the video and got.a lot of relief please show us your.support by giving this video like and.maybe subscribing to our channel too if.you have any

44eYerscDWk,How can I do 3d hip flexor stretch to help with back tightness stiffness?,"(507, 607)",hip pain what im going to be doing is a.3d hip flexor stretch thats going to.hit the muscles in.so many different directions and can.give very good relief.for those tight hip flexors im going to.be using a sturdy.foldable chair made famous in wrestling.what im going to do just simply bend.one leg at 90 degrees like this so the.knee is at 90 degrees the other one off.the chair is going to be completely.straight.lets take our hands lets place them.off to the sides of the hip.from there lets make sure that we have.good upright posture.and make sure to have no pelvic tilt im.going to do a lunging position.just like this so lets lean into it the.more that you lunge forward into it the.more youre going to feel a.great stretch in the front of the leg.that is off the chair the one that is.straight that is stretching those hip.flexors.youre also going to feel a good stretch.into the legs the butt lower back.on the opposite side try to hold this.one for 10 to 15 seconds.youre just going to come back and then.youre going to repeat this.up to five times each time go a little.bit further with it to challenge those.muscles.this is how were going to take this to.the next level lets.take our arms cross them over like this.go back into that lunging position.but lets turn towards one direction so.in this case im turning all the way.towards my right.and when you do this youre going to.notice that the back muscles the glute.buttock and the leg muscles are hit.just a little bit differently hold this.for 15 seconds.youre just going to come back and then.youre just going to repeat this again.up to five times going a little bit.further once youve done one side.just simply go to the other side and.again notice how that hits those muscles.just a little bit differently.you want to do 15 second holds five.times on the opposite side.so this is how we can take it even to,in this video i'm going to show you the.best full back stretching exercises that.you can do at home.using no equipment stay tuned.hey everyone dr rowe from spike here in.saint joseph michigan so if you're.looking for daily back stretches that.are pretty much going to hit.everything from the shoulders all the.way down to the tailbone this is a video.that you're not going to want to miss.we're going to go over easy safe and.effective.dynamic stretches that are going to help.pretty much target everything in the.back that you need.we're going to go over the muscles that.are most commonly associated with a lot.of back pain.a lot of back tightness stiffness those.type of things again.these are very good at just getting.everything moving and it's going to hit.so much in such a little amount of time.as a bonus all of these exercises can be.done at home and don't require any.special pieces of equipment.so let's get started with it and get the.back feeling better right now so with.these back stretches and exercises let's.start at the top and work our way down.towards the lower back.the first one is a modified yoga pose.called the child's pose but we're going.to do a little bit of a spin on there.what i want to do is start off on the.knees so make sure that you have a towel.or a pillow underneath for comfort and.we need a flat surface that's going to.be.a little bit elevated you can use a bed.a couch.if you're a desk worker you can use your.desk but what i'm going to do.is i'm going to bend the elbows at 90.degrees and put the back side of the.arms.just like this on that flat surface what.i'm going to do next is take the palms.right here.and then i'm going to reach behind me.and place them on the top of the.shoulders.really try to take the fingers down as.much as you can grab at the upper back.this helps stabilize this movement from.there i'm going to.tuck my chin towards my chest so this is.the movement what i'm going to do is i'm.going to take my butt.towards my heels just like this with.very good.straight posture and when i do this the.further that i go down towards the heels.you're going to feel.a very good traction stretch starting in.the upper back.that works its way down if it's tight.enough you might feel it go all the way.down to the tailbone.go as far as you feel comfortable once.you hit that point.try to hold this for 15 seconds but you.can hold it longer.up to a half minute as long as you feel.comfortable.from there come back up take a bit of a.breather.and then just simply repeat this process.up to.five times each time you do it try to go.a little bit further with it.challenge yourself because it's going to.intensify that stretch.and just get everything moving and.loosened up.so one of the biggest areas of complaint.for back tightness back pain achiness.you name it is.in between the shoulder blades so this.is one of my personal favorite ways to.really hit the rhomboid muscles.and everything in between the shoulder.blades let's go next to a wall.we're going to place one side of our.body that's facing the wall.completely flush against it from the.ankle knee hip to the shoulder right.here.i'm going to take the arm that is.closest to the wall.and also go flush with it and have it go.straight like this.at the elbow let's take the other hand.and the other arm go straight with it.and go directly over it like we're going.to be able to clap.next let's make sure that we don't have.any pelvic tilt so let's have very good.upright posture.and then from there what i'm going to do.is i'm going to take my upper body.and i'm going to lean forward at the.shoulders almost like i'm rounding my.back but i'm reaching forward with my.hands.when you do this you're going to feel.the shoulder blades.start to open up in the back it's going.to help stretch those rhomboids those.muscles in between those shoulder blades.go as far as you feel comfortable when.you hit that spot.hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five times.this is how we can take it to the next.level let's go back into that starting.position just like this.but what i'm going to do is with the uh.hand in the arm that is facing away from.the wall.let's take it out straight and then i'm.going to turn my body like this.and try to take the hand towards the.opposite.side of the wall over here and when you.do this you're going to feel a great.stretch.into the chest and also into the upper.back thoracic.area hold this for 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back.relax take a breather and then just.repeat this.up to five times for the lower back one.of the best.mobility stretches is the corkscrew and.it's a personal favorite for many people.because.it works so well that you might get a.pop snap or crack.in the back while doing it you want to.do this one.in bed so what i'm going to do is i'm.going to go to.the edge of a bed i'm going to then take.my legs place them flat.the leg that is facing away from the.edge let's.bend that one up like this and then lift.the knee up to where it's 90 degrees at.the knee like this.let's take the hand that is facing.towards the edge of the bed.and grab on the outside of that knee.that is bent.from there what i'm going to do is i'm.going to rotate this knee right here.over the edge of the bed and when you do.this you're going to start to feel a.very very good stretch.into the lower back you want to keep.taking that knee down.until you feel a great stretch sometimes.you do get a pop or a crack it's just.gas is being released from the lower.back what you want to do is you want to.hold this position for about five.seconds the next part let's take the arm.that is facing away from the edge of the.bed.and then what i'm going to do is i'm.going to take it towards the opposite.direction and i'm also going to look in.that direction you're going to.notice that this intensifies that.stretch.into the lower back but it will also.stretch into the upper back.only go to your comfort level hold this.for about 15 seconds.you're just going to relax and then.you're just going to repeat this.up to five times so this next one is.going to focus a little bit more into.the lower back especially around the.belt line into the glutes buttock.and the piriformis muscle you just need.a flat surface the edge of a bed.works perfectly what i'm going to do is.whatever side that i'm focusing on.let's take that side's leg like this.and go like this this is known as a.modified pigeon pose it's.also known as a figure four what i want.to do is position.my leg to where the knee is at 90.degrees from the ankle knee to the.hip and it's also a straight line for my.knee all the way to the hip right here.you should almost be able to put.all your weight right through here the.other leg is going to go straight.what i need to do from there is make.sure that we have good upright posture.and i'm just going to just simply cross.my arms over like.this and i'm going to lean forward into.it and when we do this we don't want to.round our back into it we want to keep.it nice and straight and.pivot from the hips just like this and.when you do it you're going to feel a.great stretch into the lower back.the glute the buttock and also into the.piriformis muscle.only go to your comfort level try to.hold this for about 15 seconds.from there you're going to relax and.then repeat up to.five times this is how we're going to.take it to the next level and.incorporate a lot of motion in there to.really target that muscle.i'm going to go back into that leaning.forward position but what i'm going to.do next is i'm going to then.rotate my body all the way over to one.certain direction in this case it's.going to be.to the right and i'm going to repeat.that you're going to notice that this.hits that muscle just a little bit.differently.go into it as far as you feel.comfortable come back up.and then you're going to turn and you're.going to just simply do that.and you want to do this pretty much all.the way from one.direction all the way to the next.so i'm going to rotate all the way over.towards my left.you're going to notice that one certain.angle one certain spot let's say right.here.hits it a little bit more than the.others.make note of that and try to do a couple.more repetitions in there because it's.going to target that muscle.and really hopefully yeah loosen it up.from there you always want to switch to.the other side to make sure.both sides are kept in balance so a huge.instigator of back issues are.tight hip flexors they can cause lower.back pelvic and.hip pain what i'm going to be doing is a.3d hip flexor stretch that's going to.hit the muscles in.so many different directions and can.give very good relief.for those tight hip flexors i'm going to.be using a sturdy.foldable chair made famous in wrestling.what i'm going to do just simply bend.one leg at 90 degrees like this so the.knee is at 90 degrees the other one off.the chair is going to be completely.straight.let's take our hands let's place them.off to the sides of the hip.from there let's make sure that we have.good upright posture.and make sure to have no pelvic tilt i'm.going to do a lunging position.just like this so let's lean into it the.more that you lunge forward into it the.more you're going to feel a.great stretch in the front of the leg.that is off the chair the one that is.straight that is stretching those hip.flexors.you're also going to feel a good stretch.into the legs the butt lower back.on the opposite side try to hold this.one for 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and then.you're going to repeat this.up to five times each time go a little.bit further with it to challenge those.muscles.this is how we're going to take this to.the next level let's.take our arms cross them over like this.go back into that lunging position.but let's turn towards one direction so.in this case i'm turning all the way.towards my right.and when you do this you're going to.notice that the back muscles the glute.buttock and the leg muscles are hit.just a little bit differently hold this.for 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and then.you're just going to repeat this again.up to five times going a little bit.further once you've done one side.just simply go to the other side and.again notice how that hits those muscles.just a little bit differently.you want to do 15 second holds five.times on the opposite side.so this is how we can take it even to.the next level from there.let me move the chair so you can see.this just a little bit more what we're.going to do.is more of a lateral side bend stretch.that's also going to hit a.main muscle in the back that is the ql.or quadratus lumborum.let's go back into that lunging position.just like this.but let's take the arms go completely.straight and put them over our heads.i'm going to do a lateral bend that is.just turning my body towards one certain.direction.and when you do this you're going to.feel a great stretch i feel it from my.armpit.all the way down to my hip you want to.keep just bending over as far as you're.able to go.hold this for up to 15 seconds you're.just going to relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five.times from there do the same thing but.then go towards the opposite direction.and when you do all of these make sure.to then switch to the other side.and repeat because you want to keep.everything balanced on both.sides so if you liked the video and got.a lot of relief please show us your.support by giving this video like and.maybe subscribing to our channel too if.you have any comments or questions.please leave them below i'll get back to.you as soon as i

44eYerscDWk,How can I do lateral side bend stretch to help with back tightness stiffness?,"(618, 658)",is more of a lateral side bend stretch.thats also going to hit a.main muscle in the back that is the ql.or quadratus lumborum.lets go back into that lunging position.just like this.but lets take the arms go completely.straight and put them over our heads.im going to do a lateral bend that is.just turning my body towards one certain.direction.and when you do this youre going to.feel a great stretch i feel it from my.armpit.all the way down to my hip you want to.keep just bending over as far as youre.able to go.hold this for up to 15 seconds youre.just going to relax.and then youre going to repeat this up.to five.times from there do the same thing but.then go towards the opposite direction,in this video i'm going to show you the.best full back stretching exercises that.you can do at home.using no equipment stay tuned.hey everyone dr rowe from spike here in.saint joseph michigan so if you're.looking for daily back stretches that.are pretty much going to hit.everything from the shoulders all the.way down to the tailbone this is a video.that you're not going to want to miss.we're going to go over easy safe and.effective.dynamic stretches that are going to help.pretty much target everything in the.back that you need.we're going to go over the muscles that.are most commonly associated with a lot.of back pain.a lot of back tightness stiffness those.type of things again.these are very good at just getting.everything moving and it's going to hit.so much in such a little amount of time.as a bonus all of these exercises can be.done at home and don't require any.special pieces of equipment.so let's get started with it and get the.back feeling better right now so with.these back stretches and exercises let's.start at the top and work our way down.towards the lower back.the first one is a modified yoga pose.called the child's pose but we're going.to do a little bit of a spin on there.what i want to do is start off on the.knees so make sure that you have a towel.or a pillow underneath for comfort and.we need a flat surface that's going to.be.a little bit elevated you can use a bed.a couch.if you're a desk worker you can use your.desk but what i'm going to do.is i'm going to bend the elbows at 90.degrees and put the back side of the.arms.just like this on that flat surface what.i'm going to do next is take the palms.right here.and then i'm going to reach behind me.and place them on the top of the.shoulders.really try to take the fingers down as.much as you can grab at the upper back.this helps stabilize this movement from.there i'm going to.tuck my chin towards my chest so this is.the movement what i'm going to do is i'm.going to take my butt.towards my heels just like this with.very good.straight posture and when i do this the.further that i go down towards the heels.you're going to feel.a very good traction stretch starting in.the upper back.that works its way down if it's tight.enough you might feel it go all the way.down to the tailbone.go as far as you feel comfortable once.you hit that point.try to hold this for 15 seconds but you.can hold it longer.up to a half minute as long as you feel.comfortable.from there come back up take a bit of a.breather.and then just simply repeat this process.up to.five times each time you do it try to go.a little bit further with it.challenge yourself because it's going to.intensify that stretch.and just get everything moving and.loosened up.so one of the biggest areas of complaint.for back tightness back pain achiness.you name it is.in between the shoulder blades so this.is one of my personal favorite ways to.really hit the rhomboid muscles.and everything in between the shoulder.blades let's go next to a wall.we're going to place one side of our.body that's facing the wall.completely flush against it from the.ankle knee hip to the shoulder right.here.i'm going to take the arm that is.closest to the wall.and also go flush with it and have it go.straight like this.at the elbow let's take the other hand.and the other arm go straight with it.and go directly over it like we're going.to be able to clap.next let's make sure that we don't have.any pelvic tilt so let's have very good.upright posture.and then from there what i'm going to do.is i'm going to take my upper body.and i'm going to lean forward at the.shoulders almost like i'm rounding my.back but i'm reaching forward with my.hands.when you do this you're going to feel.the shoulder blades.start to open up in the back it's going.to help stretch those rhomboids those.muscles in between those shoulder blades.go as far as you feel comfortable when.you hit that spot.hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five times.this is how we can take it to the next.level let's go back into that starting.position just like this.but what i'm going to do is with the uh.hand in the arm that is facing away from.the wall.let's take it out straight and then i'm.going to turn my body like this.and try to take the hand towards the.opposite.side of the wall over here and when you.do this you're going to feel a great.stretch.into the chest and also into the upper.back thoracic.area hold this for 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back.relax take a breather and then just.repeat this.up to five times for the lower back one.of the best.mobility stretches is the corkscrew and.it's a personal favorite for many people.because.it works so well that you might get a.pop snap or crack.in the back while doing it you want to.do this one.in bed so what i'm going to do is i'm.going to go to.the edge of a bed i'm going to then take.my legs place them flat.the leg that is facing away from the.edge let's.bend that one up like this and then lift.the knee up to where it's 90 degrees at.the knee like this.let's take the hand that is facing.towards the edge of the bed.and grab on the outside of that knee.that is bent.from there what i'm going to do is i'm.going to rotate this knee right here.over the edge of the bed and when you do.this you're going to start to feel a.very very good stretch.into the lower back you want to keep.taking that knee down.until you feel a great stretch sometimes.you do get a pop or a crack it's just.gas is being released from the lower.back what you want to do is you want to.hold this position for about five.seconds the next part let's take the arm.that is facing away from the edge of the.bed.and then what i'm going to do is i'm.going to take it towards the opposite.direction and i'm also going to look in.that direction you're going to.notice that this intensifies that.stretch.into the lower back but it will also.stretch into the upper back.only go to your comfort level hold this.for about 15 seconds.you're just going to relax and then.you're just going to repeat this.up to five times so this next one is.going to focus a little bit more into.the lower back especially around the.belt line into the glutes buttock.and the piriformis muscle you just need.a flat surface the edge of a bed.works perfectly what i'm going to do is.whatever side that i'm focusing on.let's take that side's leg like this.and go like this this is known as a.modified pigeon pose it's.also known as a figure four what i want.to do is position.my leg to where the knee is at 90.degrees from the ankle knee to the.hip and it's also a straight line for my.knee all the way to the hip right here.you should almost be able to put.all your weight right through here the.other leg is going to go straight.what i need to do from there is make.sure that we have good upright posture.and i'm just going to just simply cross.my arms over like.this and i'm going to lean forward into.it and when we do this we don't want to.round our back into it we want to keep.it nice and straight and.pivot from the hips just like this and.when you do it you're going to feel a.great stretch into the lower back.the glute the buttock and also into the.piriformis muscle.only go to your comfort level try to.hold this for about 15 seconds.from there you're going to relax and.then repeat up to.five times this is how we're going to.take it to the next level and.incorporate a lot of motion in there to.really target that muscle.i'm going to go back into that leaning.forward position but what i'm going to.do next is i'm going to then.rotate my body all the way over to one.certain direction in this case it's.going to be.to the right and i'm going to repeat.that you're going to notice that this.hits that muscle just a little bit.differently.go into it as far as you feel.comfortable come back up.and then you're going to turn and you're.going to just simply do that.and you want to do this pretty much all.the way from one.direction all the way to the next.so i'm going to rotate all the way over.towards my left.you're going to notice that one certain.angle one certain spot let's say right.here.hits it a little bit more than the.others.make note of that and try to do a couple.more repetitions in there because it's.going to target that muscle.and really hopefully yeah loosen it up.from there you always want to switch to.the other side to make sure.both sides are kept in balance so a huge.instigator of back issues are.tight hip flexors they can cause lower.back pelvic and.hip pain what i'm going to be doing is a.3d hip flexor stretch that's going to.hit the muscles in.so many different directions and can.give very good relief.for those tight hip flexors i'm going to.be using a sturdy.foldable chair made famous in wrestling.what i'm going to do just simply bend.one leg at 90 degrees like this so the.knee is at 90 degrees the other one off.the chair is going to be completely.straight.let's take our hands let's place them.off to the sides of the hip.from there let's make sure that we have.good upright posture.and make sure to have no pelvic tilt i'm.going to do a lunging position.just like this so let's lean into it the.more that you lunge forward into it the.more you're going to feel a.great stretch in the front of the leg.that is off the chair the one that is.straight that is stretching those hip.flexors.you're also going to feel a good stretch.into the legs the butt lower back.on the opposite side try to hold this.one for 10 to 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and then.you're going to repeat this.up to five times each time go a little.bit further with it to challenge those.muscles.this is how we're going to take this to.the next level let's.take our arms cross them over like this.go back into that lunging position.but let's turn towards one direction so.in this case i'm turning all the way.towards my right.and when you do this you're going to.notice that the back muscles the glute.buttock and the leg muscles are hit.just a little bit differently hold this.for 15 seconds.you're just going to come back and then.you're just going to repeat this again.up to five times going a little bit.further once you've done one side.just simply go to the other side and.again notice how that hits those muscles.just a little bit differently.you want to do 15 second holds five.times on the opposite side.so this is how we can take it even to.the next level from there.let me move the chair so you can see.this just a little bit more what we're.going to do.is more of a lateral side bend stretch.that's also going to hit a.main muscle in the back that is the ql.or quadratus lumborum.let's go back into that lunging position.just like this.but let's take the arms go completely.straight and put them over our heads.i'm going to do a lateral bend that is.just turning my body towards one certain.direction.and when you do this you're going to.feel a great stretch i feel it from my.armpit.all the way down to my hip you want to.keep just bending over as far as you're.able to go.hold this for up to 15 seconds you're.just going to relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five.times from there do the same thing but.then go towards the opposite direction.and when you do all of these make sure.to then switch to the other side.and repeat because you want to keep.everything balanced on both.sides so if you liked the video and got.a lot of relief please show us your.support by giving this video like and.maybe subscribing to our channel too if.you have any comments or questions.please leave them below i'll get

LL854--GBy4,How does the crowning of the teeth alter the biting surface?,"(241, 320)",Would be if you had tooth decay on the backside of the tooth and I was going to show that to you there.Im a fucking focus.So on this model here you can see Im showing you the backside of teeth very rarely.Do you get any sort of decay right where my finger is in this backside of the tooth and.This is the area that.Is really important to maintain your natural tooth structure.Heres why its so important.So if you look where my fingers are at.You can see all of this this portion of the back of the side of the front teeth.And I take this other model which is the lower jaw and I put it together.One thing youll notice is whered you chew right its kind of hard to see maybe on this model.But there it is you chew right up against the backside of.Those those front teeth and so when you start grinding away.to do a traditional crown on the backside of these front teeth youre going to change that surface now to.be something that is going to be a.restoration that is chewing against your lower teeth that are natural and.That that sounds okay except for the fact that long term this causes your lower teeth to get more wear.And its also likely to have.wear on the backside of your restoration or.Chipping or breaking there to the crown over time because the way that the bite connects so hopefully that makes sense,"What's up guys this is dr O from innovative dental and today.I want to talk to you about why you should not get crowns on your front teeth.Chances are if you've gone to your dentist or have been concerned about having your your.front teeth addressed from tooth decay or.Even just not pleased to the way that they look you may have been advised to get crowns done on your front teeth.There's there's some reasons why I would encourage a patient not to go down that route most of the time we can avoid that first.They're too aggressive so.when you are cutting on a tooth to prepare it for a crown you have to remove almost all of the enamel and.this leaves the tooth more susceptible to.Fracture more septal to break it also would make the tooth.Likely to have more.Sensitivity and maybe even need a root canal in the future so when you crown a tooth and you cut all the enamel away.It's definitely more likely to be a problem down the road and you might ask yourself.So why in the world do we have to cut all the way around the tooth and?.one of the reasons that we do that is for decades.we've not really had another solution to.Making the tooth have some sort of temporary why the lab makes your crown.And so we have to put a temporary.plastic tooth on top of your existing.prep on them basically the tooth that we just cut down and.that plastic tooth has to have some sort of shape to hold on to and so that's why we were taught in dental school to.Cut around the tooth to prepare it in a way.That would hold the temporary so we're really treating the tooth based off of our.Necessity to put a temporary on it now fast forward right the technologies.Come a long way, and now we can actually make the crown while in one visit while you are here.And we don't require a lab to make the the restoration anymore.So since we don't need a lab you can imagine.we don't have to have a temporary and since we don't need a.Temporary we don't have to shape the tooth the same way.There's a lot of benefits to you for that because that means we only have to treat the portion of the tooth that gives you.the cosmetic benefit of.changing the shade and the shape of the tooth and.Be getting rid of the decay that's there and so most of the time we can do both of those things with something.That's much less.Aggressive crowns are just too aggressive almost always so if your dentist is recommended at crown.I would encourage you to maybe ask them.Why they feel they feel they need a crown, and if it really comes down to the fact that that you need a temporary.Or they need to send it off to a lab, then I'd be I can be concerned with that.You got to seek out a dentist that has technology because it's been around for a while that allows us to.Fix the tooth in one visit and save more of your tooth structure avoid all those challenges and problems that are listed earlier about.You know tooth pain less your tooth around I mean.I think about if you're like a 35 year old and you're getting your tooth cut on to put a crown on it that crown.Maybe lasts you 20 years, but in 20 years you're gonna need another crown and when they cut that old one off.There's gonna be even less tooth structure there so each time you're getting this tooth treatment.You're more likely to have it break hurt and have problems for you down the road so just avoid crowns if you can almost.Never need it in dental school.We were taught how to prepare teeth for crowns and not for veneers so you're gonna most of the time run into.Dentists that are really trained on crown prep and maybe not on veneer proud and so crowns you're going to basically take the burr.Reduce the tooth about a millimeter on top and cut all the way around.Essentially removing all of your enamel now if the tooth is badly damaged then.Then maybe this is necessary.But the only area that really necessitates or requires us to be that aggressive and remove the enamel all the way around the tooth.Would be if you had tooth decay on the backside of the tooth, and I was going to show that to you there.I'm a fucking focus.So on this model here you can see I'm showing you the backside of teeth very rarely.Do you get any sort of decay right where my finger is in this backside of the tooth and?.This is the area that.Is really important to maintain your natural tooth structure?.Here's why it's so important.So if you look where my fingers are at?.You can see all of this this portion of the back of the side of the front teeth.And I take this other model, which is the lower jaw and I put it together?.One thing you'll notice is where'd you chew right it's kind of hard to see maybe on this model.But there it is you chew right up against the backside of.Those those front teeth and so when you start grinding away.to do a traditional crown on the backside of these front teeth you're going to change that surface now to.be something that is going to be a.restoration that is chewing against your lower teeth that are natural and.That that sounds okay except for the fact that long term this causes your lower teeth to get more wear.And it's also likely to have.wear on the backside of your restoration or.Chipping or breaking there to the crown over time because the way that the bite connects, so hopefully that makes sense.But that's that's one reason that's really the second reason why I would avoid crowns is that it changes the bite surface of.Your natural teeth to a prosthetic and it's really not in an area that that's not super beneficial for you.Maybe even a third reason why you might want to avoid?.having a crown done on a front tooth is.You've heard of you know the reason we would typically do a crown is to make it stronger.Help hold a tooth together That's had a lot of decay or old restorations, and we would put the crown on top.And we put it on top and you have chewing forces like this.It's going the Crown's gonna actually be giving that tooth.Additional strength the fact that that tooth doesn't have the enamel there anymore is not too damaging considering the forces this way.Now if you take a front tooth.So you have a tooth in front where you?.Your forces really are more of this this type of chewing forces where you go like that and you have a little bit of.lateral forces on the front teeth.Those lateral forces on teeth that you've taken all the enamel away are not very healthy and so I've seen a lot of.Patients who have had crowns on front teeth and their teeth are severely weakened.And they will have the tooth break.and I'm wondering if they wouldn't have broken if we would have been more conservative and.Kept the enamel on the backside of their front teeth alright, so hopefully I made it clear why I'm apparently done.Just go hang out.It's my dog Baxter you can't see me over there in the corner.Alright, so hopefully I've made the case for.What are some of the risks or challenges and maybe why you shouldn't have a crown.Done on on your front teeth so then the question is well I've got some problems I've got some tooth decay.I've got a fracture yeah, you know cool.I'm glad you made me understand why I don't need a crown, but what am I supposed to do?.I believe that most dentists that are really are providing the most conservative care are going to be comfortable doing.3/4 crowns or partial crowns that don't cut down the backside of the the tooth and.They will also be able to do veneers and veneers are just maybe similar to a 3/4 crown.Maybe even a little more conservative than that in their prep These are great ways to.Avoid long term challenges or problems with your teeth.So I would encourage you to go to a dentist who has the ability to create same-day.restorations that'll be a big benefit to you and.Go to a dentist who understands how to prepare teeth for veneers and doesn't require or recommend.Crowns when the backside of the tooth is healthy the the topic of this video came up from just just this last week I had.patient come in and.Had some concerns with their smile and wanted to improve it and they came to me and they were fairly young and they were.Recommended to have I believe it was like 20 crowns performed and prepped on their teeth and they were very young.Obviously it's a big concern to me.I advise the patient definitely don't do that go to a dentist that is going to be able to prepare the teeth.much more minimally so you have the best chance of having long-term health there and.Here at innovative dental we pride ourselves on that so hopefully this video is helpful I'm Maya my goal.here is to just try to educate and bring some insight into what modern dentistry can do for you and.Obviously if you have questions or concerns or things that maybe came up throughout the video, please post them below.Otherwise give it a like thumbs up Smash that thumbs up if you can with your phone and.Subscribe to the channel, I'll be uploading about every week to try to come up with new topics

measured.and there is a handy guide that come in.supplies where you can look and see the.measurement from the earlobe to the base.of the nose right here where the flesh.ends and that you would take that.measurement and then divide it in two so.if you had four inches on the ruler you.would take and actually mark on your.swab where two inches would be so in.this case you would mark right about the.junction of the thick portion of the.swab narrowing down in the case of the,I'm dr alida Bonner I'm a pediatric.emergency medicine physician who also.does a lot of point of care research and.I work at Bedell Children's Medical.Center of Central Texas in Austin Texas.I specialize in pediatric emergency.medicine and I also do a lot of point of.care testing research in children and.adults I'm here today to help produce a.video to help train people how to do.correct nasopharyngeal swabs my.expertise in point of care testing has.had been obtained several thousand of.these so I thought I would help impart a.little of that knowledge and expertise.to you today there are two different.swabs today that we're going to feature.the first swab these are both made by.copn they are the mini tip flocked.swabs you can see that there's a little.fine kind of bristly end I tell people.it's kind of analogous to the fuzzy part.of a pipe cleaner some people don't know.where a pipe cleaner is anymore the top.swab has a little thicker less flexible.shaft the lower swab has a little longer.portion of the narrow shaft and is more.flexible I actually prefer the top swab.more for collection both in children and.adults all the way from infants or.adults because the top less flexible.area actually lets me have better.control of the swab when I place it in.and go under the inferior turbinates you.can actually feel as you do the rotation.that you're actually getting better.control sometimes with this less.flexible shaft especially in littler.kids that you're only inserting at a.small distance there is not as much.control and you tend to have a little.more flex in the swab shaft causing it.not.pickup sells quite as well so I.typically preferred this shaft over the.lower one but both work equally well as.far as picking up a sample one of the.things to note when you insert the swab.is to go in a horizontal configuration.to the patient's head you can see on.this diagram feet I don't use my squab.as a pointer that you're actually going.horizontally.you're not going vertically you don't.want to insert this right up into the.nose like you would normally think the.nasal passages are going to get under.the inferior turbinates you're actually.going to start at the very base of the.nose in this little fleshy area and.you're going to go gently over that skin.and you will feel this long slide right.into this area if you do it correctly.like this the swab slides straight in.it's a minimal discomfort to the patient.and they'll feel more of a tickling type.sensation sometimes have just a little.bit of tearing in the eye on that side.but this is not painful at all and you.notice that the key is that this one is.horizontal not vertically tilted as it's.only showing here and that's the key so.I'm going to go through a couple of.steps and show you exactly how this is.done I also want to tell you that as far.as protective wear and gear some people.will deck out in everything including a.gown gloves mask.eye shields typically in my setting the.rest.therapist techs doctors nurses we all.just put on a pair of gloves if we have.concern that the child or adult has a.more significant illness something more.contagious like TV then full precautions.with all the body here would be.appropriate but in the setting where.you're going to be doing nasopharyngeal.swabs typically all you need are a pair.of gloves.some people may choose to also put on a.little face shield or a mask if they.feel like the kid might COFF on them and.because them to catch illness but that's.more to protect you.than anything as I told you I've.collected several thousand nasal.pharyngeal swabs over the past several.years doing point-of-care research so.for me the depth of insertion of an.nasal pharyngeal are and the V swab is.fairly intuitive and I can do it almost.with my eyes closed but I would.recommend keeping them open the depth of.insertion is actually easily measured.and there is a handy guide that come in.supplies where you can look and see the.measurement from the earlobe to the base.of the nose right here where the flesh.ends and that you would take that.measurement and then divide it in two so.if you had four inches on the ruler you.would take and actually mark on your.swab where two inches would be so in.this case you would mark right about the.junction of the thick portion of the.swab narrowing down in the case of the.adult on this particular swab that works.out perfectly almost every time for this.junction to be the correct depth of.insertion with a child or an infant.you're going to go a little less deep so.measuring.very good especially in the younger kids.so that you don't insert the swab too.far I'm now going to demonstrate.inserting the swab correctly on myself.and I'm going to show you how to do it.where it causes a patient minimal.discomfort and can easily be done in any.type of setting with the swab you're.going to take it and very gently guide.it into the Nair and you're going to.feel it go just up and over and about.this area you'll feel it just go over.that little skin ledge at the bottom of.the nose at that point you want to take.in and go horizontal and just continue.to insert until you felt the correct.depth and in this case I can feel I'm.under the inferior turbinates you can.see that this is not a noxious thing.it's not causing me any discomfort I'm.still sitting here fairly casually.talking to you and not crying kicking or.screaming.you've been removed the swab and you.should see a nice little coating of.mucus on the swab at that point if you.don't you should take the swab and.gently insert it into the second there.do the same thing just repeat the entire.process once you've gotten your swab out.you can either take it and go directly.to a point of care testing or you can.take it and put it into transport media.and you will see that there is a nice.little reddish pink line right here.which is the guide to break this off.into the tube of the media and as I do.this on several other children you'll.see that I will actually break the swab.off and you'll see how easily it steps.off and goes in here too,"{'(1.909, 7.17)': ""I'm dr alida Bonner I'm a pediatric"", '(4.649, 9.6)': 'emergency medicine physician who also', '(7.17, 12.33)': 'does

until you felt the correct.depth and in this case I can feel Im.under the inferior turbinates you can.see that this is not a noxious thing.its not causing me any discomfort Im.still sitting here fairly casually.talking to you and not crying kicking or.screaming.youve been removed the swab and you.should see a nice little coating of.mucus on the swab at that point if you.dont you should take the swab and,I'm dr alida Bonner I'm a pediatric.emergency medicine physician who also.does a lot of point of care research and.I work at Bedell Children's Medical.Center of Central Texas in Austin Texas.I specialize in pediatric emergency.medicine and I also do a lot of point of.care testing research in children and.adults I'm here today to help produce a.video to help train people how to do.correct nasopharyngeal swabs my.expertise in point of care testing has.had been obtained several thousand of.these so I thought I would help impart a.little of that knowledge and expertise.to you today there are two different.swabs today that we're going to feature.the first swab these are both made by.copn they are the mini tip flocked.swabs you can see that there's a little.fine kind of bristly end I tell people.it's kind of analogous to the fuzzy part.of a pipe cleaner some people don't know.where a pipe cleaner is anymore the top.swab has a little thicker less flexible.shaft the lower swab has a little longer.portion of the narrow shaft and is more.flexible I actually prefer the top swab.more for collection both in children and.adults all the way from infants or.adults because the top less flexible.area actually lets me have better.control of the swab when I place it in.and go under the inferior turbinates you.can actually feel as you do the rotation.that you're actually getting better.control sometimes with this less.flexible shaft especially in littler.kids that you're only inserting at a.small distance there is not as much.control and you tend to have a little.more flex in the swab shaft causing it.not.pickup sells quite as well so I.typically preferred this shaft over the.lower one but both work equally well as.far as picking up a sample one of the.things to note when you insert the swab.is to go in a horizontal configuration.to the patient's head you can see on.this diagram feet I don't use my squab.as a pointer that you're actually going.horizontally.you're not going vertically you don't.want to insert this right up into the.nose like you would normally think the.nasal passages are going to get under.the inferior turbinates you're actually.going to start at the very base of the.nose in this little fleshy area and.you're going to go gently over that skin.and you will feel this long slide right.into this area if you do it correctly.like this the swab slides straight in.it's a minimal discomfort to the patient.and they'll feel more of a tickling type.sensation sometimes have just a little.bit of tearing in the eye on that side.but this is not painful at all and you.notice that the key is that this one is.horizontal not vertically tilted as it's.only showing here and that's the key so.I'm going to go through a couple of.steps and show you exactly how this is.done I also want to tell you that as far.as protective wear and gear some people.will deck out in everything including a.gown gloves mask.eye shields typically in my setting the.rest.therapist techs doctors nurses we all.just put on a pair of gloves if we have.concern that the child or adult has a.more significant illness something more.contagious like TV then full precautions.with all the body here would be.appropriate but in the setting where.you're going to be doing nasopharyngeal.swabs typically all you need are a pair.of gloves.some people may choose to also put on a.little face shield or a mask if they.feel like the kid might COFF on them and.because them to catch illness but that's.more to protect you.than anything as I told you I've.collected several thousand nasal.pharyngeal swabs over the past several.years doing point-of-care research so.for me the depth of insertion of an.nasal pharyngeal are and the V swab is.fairly intuitive and I can do it almost.with my eyes closed but I would.recommend keeping them open the depth of.insertion is actually easily measured.and there is a handy guide that come in.supplies where you can look and see the.measurement from the earlobe to the base.of the nose right here where the flesh.ends and that you would take that.measurement and then divide it in two so.if you had four inches on the ruler you.would take and actually mark on your.swab where two inches would be so in.this case you would mark right about the.junction of the thick portion of the.swab narrowing down in the case of the.adult on this particular swab that works.out perfectly almost every time for this.junction to be the correct depth of.insertion with a child or an infant.you're going to go a little less deep so.measuring.very good especially in the younger kids.so that you don't insert the swab too.far I'm now going to demonstrate.inserting the swab correctly on myself.and I'm going to show you how to do it.where it causes a patient minimal.discomfort and can easily be done in any.type of setting with the swab you're.going to take it and very gently guide.it into the Nair and you're going to.feel it go just up and over and about.this area you'll feel it just go over.that little skin ledge at the bottom of.the nose at that point you want to take.in and go horizontal and just continue.to

take the swab and.gently insert it into the second there.do the same thing just repeat the entire.process once you've gotten your swab out.you can either take it and go directly.to a point of care testing or you can.take it and put it into transport media.and you will see that there is a nice.little reddish pink line right here.which is the guide to break this off.into the tube of the media and as I do.this on several other children you'll.see that I will actually break the swab.off and you'll see how easily it steps.off and goes in here too,"{'(1.909, 7.17)': ""I'm dr alida Bonner I'm a

1Nr6wPFz09A,How to fix a crick in your neck by bending toward the crick?,"(115, 174)",whats the best way to start getting rid.of some of that pain see you tomorrow.okay so you have an acute episode of.neck pain what should you do first off.go ahead and do all those things as you.normally would do it for any other type.of muscular injury do some ice if you.like it do some heat if you like it take.some ibuprofen or some Advil all those.things are good the one thing that most.people do that I think is opposite.what they should actually do is they.actually try to stretch and move their.head and neck in the opposite direction.of the pain meaning like if my hand neck.hurt on this side theyre theyre kind.of stretching to this side theyre.turning away from it trying to make this.side longer when these muscles here are.already hurting because theyre.stretched out thats typically the cause.so instead of stretching and moving away.from the pain I want you to actually.move towards the pain and kind of side.bend towards the side that hurts rotate.towards the side that hurts then also.use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up.like this or anything that you can.elevate your arm on to help slacken the.muscle there and that goes a long way.towards relieving the pain okay guys so,okay guys I am super excited about this.month's video series because it's all.about the next so a couple months ago I.did a series on the back you know what.to do when your back goes out so this.month it's gonna be what to do when your.neck goes out or when you wake up with a.crick in your neck the first video is.going to be on what exactly happens.there is it a muscle thing is it a bone.thing we'll talk about that the second.thing I'm gonna talk about is what to do.pretty pretty close to right away after.you find that you have some neck pain I.find a lot of you do the exact opposite.thing you should be doing with acute.neck pains we're going to talk about.that and then the third thing we're.gonna talk about is my number one.favorite exercise that I like to use to.strengthen the neck to avoid some of.these neck problems so join me in just a.few days it might be tomorrow might be.the next day and we'll start this video.series and I think you guys will like it.and learn a lot about your neck so I'll.talk to you soon back okay so a crick in.the neck is usually a muscular thing and.it typically happens in one or two ways.one is kind of a neck strain that you.get from maybe lifting something too.heavy or doing an exercise where you.really kind of strain into your neck and.the second way is when you have your.head in a position and it can be either.way where the the pain in the neck can.come from this part of the side of the.neck where the muscles have been.compressed and are too short or it can.be from this side where the muscles are.stretched and too long it's usually this.side I find in most of my patients so.you also feel a lot of times with with.neck pain you'll also feel it kind of.going down into the shoulder blade so.you can kind of see here this muscle.here the levator SCAP kind of comes off.the off this vertebra and comes down out.to the shoulder blade so you often kind.of feel pain down in there so tomorrow.we'll talk about what to do when you.have this kind of muscular pain and.what's the best way to start getting rid.of some of that pain see you tomorrow.okay so you have an acute episode of.neck pain what should you do first off.go ahead and do all those things as you.normally would do it for any other type.of muscular injury do some ice if you.like it do some heat if you like it take.some ibuprofen or some Advil all those.things are good the one thing that most.people do that I think is opposite.what they should actually do is they.actually try to stretch and move their.head and neck in the opposite direction.of the pain meaning like if my hand neck.hurt on this side they're they're kind.of stretching to this side they're.turning away from it trying to make this.side longer when these muscles here are.already hurting because they're.stretched out that's typically the cause.so instead of stretching and moving away.from the pain I want you to actually.move towards the pain and kind of side.bend towards the side that hurts rotate.towards the side that hurts then also.use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up.like this or anything that you can.elevate your arm on to help slacken the.muscle there and that goes a long way.towards relieving the pain okay guys so.this is my favorite exercise for the.neck I think of it as kind of a.control-alt-delete for your neck pain so.you can do this when you're having an.acute episode of neck pain or you can.also do is just a general strengthening.exercise and the neck exercise I'm.talking about is doing cervical.retraction so it looks a little bit like.this you're going to be keeping your.face as flat as possible I don't want to.see your chin going up and down and.you're just moving your head straight.back just like this back and forth you.can do 20 or 30 at a time you'll feel a.little bit of strengthening kind of.anteriorly in the front of the neck and.a little bit of stretch in the back of.the neck make sure you're not moving.your whole body and just make sure that.you're using just your head so that's my.favorite neck exercise I hope you guys.got a lot out of this series on the neck.and I will talk to you guys later bye,"{'(0.03, 4.95)': 'okay guys I am super excited about this', '(2.55, 6.899)': ""month's video series because it's all"",

VYXSyQmTAXQ,How to relieve calf strain with foam roller massage?,"(142, 180)",who arent familiar with the rolling.just a very quick  Yeah a good idea.If you have a knot right here in your calf.usually if you have calf pain.if you palpate or feel in the muscle.youll find a ropey tender spot.where its tight its tender.and thats what we have to roll out.We have to get in there and massage it.with a deep massager or you can use the roller.like this and you could work on it.go over that.Its a little uncomfortable but if you work with it.it can work out and its kind of one of those things.that hurts but it hurts so good.because when youre done it feels good.Now the other option that were gonna talk about," Bob and Brad   The two most famous   Physical therapists   On the internet  Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, Physical Therapist.Brad Heineck, Physical Therapist.Together we are the mot famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion, of course, Bob.Today we're gonna talk about calf strains,.knots, that's pain in the calf,.usually the mid calf, right Brad?.Yep.And how to stop that pain in 90 seconds.without painful rolling or deep massage.When we did videos of both of those,.they can be very effective,.but why go through the pain of that.if you don't need to?.We're gonna show you a different option.Right.I think this is gonna be a different tool.in your toolbox.There ya go Bob.So, by the way, if you're new to our Channel,.please take a second to subscribe to us.We provide videos on how to stay healthy, fit,.pain free, and we upload every day.Also, what are we giving away Mike?.Booyah!.Booyah, this is the page.Go to bobandbradcom,.we're always giving something away.This week we're giving away the booyah stick,.Brad's gonna grab one.You can also go to Facebook, it'll be there,.the contest will be pinned.to the top of the page, bobandbrad.Short version of this, go Twitter, Instagram,.or TikTok, and you will get 60 seconds.of Bob and Brad a day.Here's the booyah stick Booyah!.Great for shoulder problems, balance,.what else do we use it for, Brad?.Posture? Posture, Bob.We'll use it for strengthening exer-.A weapon.Yeah, be careful with it Bob.All right, let's go to work, Brad.All right, so calf strain.Very common injury, particularly with people.who walk a lot, run a lot, up and down stairs,.those types of things.And very painful, and they can drag on for a long time,.so how do we get rid of them?.Traditionally, before this episode,.we've done a number of videos.on effective ways to do it.with a cross friction massage,.or the roller Foam roller, yeah.Which we still say, these are good options.They are good options.This option is different, and it doesn't require.the pain that deep rolling does.Or it doesn't require the equipment.There you go Bob, even better.You can do this laying down in your bed actually,.and that's what I would recommend.But you don't have to, you can do it on the floor.Okay.So, I'm just gonna, for those people.who aren't familiar with the rolling,.just a very quick Yeah, a good idea.If you have a knot, right here in your calf,.usually if you have calf pain,.if you palpate or feel in the muscle,.you'll find a ropey tender spot.where it's tight, it's tender,.and that's what we have to roll out.We have to get in there and massage it.with a deep massager, or you can use the roller,.like this, and you could work on it,.go over that.It's a little uncomfortable, but if you work with it,.it can work out, and it's kind of one of those things.that hurts, but it hurts so good.because when you're done, it feels good.Now, the other option that we're gonna talk about.feels good and there's no pain involved.As a matter of fact, it feels good,.good throughout the whole thing.I'm gonna use a pillow, as a matter of fact,.I recommend getting a pillow so you can get.more comfortable.So let's say, with the technique,.'cause we're not gonna keep a secret here,.this is called the positional release,.or back in the day this was.technique-.[Bob] Strain and counter strain.Yeah, it's been around for many years.Decades actually.So, let's say I have a calf strain right here,.and what I'm gonna do is lay like this.Get comfortable, I'm gonna put my foot here.so I can relax.There you go, I'm gonna show a little leg,.don't get excited, ha ha!.Bob, it's not that funny!.So, I'm gonna go in here and just palpate around.Now, the muscle fibers go this way,.so I'm gonna go right to left,.and I work up and down.I'm gonna, usually even if you don't have a strain,.you can find a tender spot right.[Bob] So you're really not treating it right now,.you're just looking for the painful spot?.[Brad] Right, trying to find the source of that-.[Bob] And you already have it on slack a little bit.[Brad] Right.[Bob] Because the knee's bent.[Brad] Right.[Bob] And a lot of people may not know that,.but the calf muscle crosses over the knee.[Brad] Right.[Bob] One of them.[Brad] One of them does, right.Plus, if you look at my ankle,.it's plantar flexed,.so I have the muscle on slack,.and I'm looking for tender spot.[Bob] That's more relaxing.[Brad] Yeah, exactly.Good point Bob.And I can find one right there,.it's kind of on the right hand side a little bit.It may be in the center, it may be here,.it may be down in the soleus muscle,.but you need to find it, and you will.Let's say I'm gonna go to this,.I palpate it, right there it is.I'd give that about a three or a four.when I work over it.[Bob] Okay, on a scale zero to 10.[Brad] Right.[Bob] Or one to ten.[Brad] Yep, so I'm gonna note that.Now, if you've got a real strain,.you're probably gonna be up to around a seven.or an eight when you hit that spot and push on it.[Bob] So again, that's the level of irritation or pain.There you go, and that's,.so you don't do any more of that.That's all the pain you're gonna really feel.in this technique [Bob] Okay.Then you have to go to a position.of maximal relaxation and minimal pain,.so I'm gonna flex the knee.Now this is the part, that as a therapist,.we know that if we flex the knee,.and we plantar flex the foot maximally,.that's gonna shorten the calf muscles up maximally,.and that's what we want.Now, the other trick is,.you may have to take your foot,.I'm gonna lower the knee so you could see it.Either evert it this way or invert it this way,.and the way you know if you're in the right place,.right position, is it feels best.So, in mine, because I don't have an injury.it's hard to say, but I think I could feel.a little best, now if you have an injury,.you'll probably notice it.[Bob] Yeah, you'll probably be able to tell immediately.[Brad] If it's on the outside, it's probably,.if you bring the foot towards that direction,.but you experiment, see where it feels best.And once you find the spot, and then you're.just going to hold and relax,.then you have to time that for 90 seconds,.pardon me, 90 seconds, and just relax.Breathe comfortably, relax.Make sure you clock it at 90 seconds,.don't go less than that.It was real critical with the .[Bob] The timing is really important.Right.If you're gonna hold it for 30 seconds, 45 seconds,.it's not long enough for the muscles to relax.This is a neurological, this has been studied,.and I'm not gonna go through the science.of the neurological release,.but it's all figured out [Bob] Sure.And after that 90 seconds,.you could go longer than 90 seconds if you want,.then you're gonna just relax.[Bob] Slowly Slowly.Yep, let it come down and then you can wiggle.your ankle up and down.Everything's gentle, relaxed, you're not going.to get into any of that aggressive,.you're not gonna get the roller out.Although, there was another study,.they combined rolling with-.[Bob] Along with this.Yeah, and I don't know the protocol,.but they said that was successful too, but again-.[Bob] We weren't sure if they did the rolling first,.or the rolling-.No, I didn't read the article,.but they said there's a combination.That'll come in time, Bob.[Bob] And I would think that's what I would be doing.with this, Brad, I would probably be doing.a combination Combination, sure.I mean, you could try this alone.Yeah.I mean, I have to be honest Brad,.I became a big believer of how this worked.on my hip Sure.And I could definitely tell with my hip flexors,.that they relaxed,.and I don't know if it's a coincidence,.but I don't feel it when I'm running now.There you go.So, I mean-.Oh, we forgot one little part,.piece of information (laughs).I got so excited about-.Sure.After the 90 seconds,.you should go back to that painful spot.[Bob] Oh, and just to see how it's doing.To see did it- Yep,.and then press on it again.Before, I was at a three or a four,.yeah, it's about a one right now.I can still feel it, but it's decreased.It wasn't bad to begin with, but definitely better now.[Bob] And this is to show you that it's working.And to show you it's amazing how just by putting.that muscle in a maximal relaxed position,.that it can actually calm it down.That's how the name counter strain,.you got the strain, typically from a stretch.or an activity like that,.the counter strain is going the opposite.Sure.So, If it was a real injury.and you're at a seven or eight,.you could easily get down to a one or a two.after the 90 seconds.Again, if you have the calf issue,.you're going to be able to tell right away.I wonder if this does work with neuropathy and stuff,.just because you know, there's secondary pain.from neuropathy, that the muscles start to react.Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good point.And so, I mean to be calf pain,.a lot of the times the pain's in the feet and stuff,.but I'm just cogitating,.thinking through all this.Right, well, when we got our spare time,.we'll look into the literature,.and we'll inform you as we find out.And we'll get back to you, so.Remember, Brad and I can fix just about anything.Except for.A broken heart, but we're working on it.Oh Bob, why Bob?.Why the violence with me?","{'(0.36, 2.216)': ' Bob and Brad  , '(2.216, 4.338)': ' The two most

VYXSyQmTAXQ,How to relieve calf strain or pain by palpating your tender spot?,"(308, 430)", Then you have to go to a position.of maximal relaxation and minimal pain.so Im gonna flex the knee.Now this is the part that as a therapist.we know that if we flex the knee.and we plantar flex the foot maximally.thats gonna shorten the calf muscles up maximally.and thats what we want.Now the other trick is.you may have to take your foot.Im gonna lower the knee so you could see it.Either evert it this way or invert it this way.and the way you know if youre in the right place.right position is it feels best.So in mine because I dont have an injury.its hard to say but I think I could feel.a little best now if you have an injury.youll probably notice it. Bob Yeah youll probably be able to tell immediately. Brad If its on the outside its probably.if you bring the foot towards that direction.but you experiment see where it feels best.And once you find the spot and then youre.just going to hold and relax.then you have to time that for 90 seconds.pardon me 90 seconds and just relax.Breathe comfortably relax.Make sure you clock it at 90 seconds.dont go less than that.It was real critical with the . Bob The timing is really important. Right.If youre gonna hold it for 30 seconds 45 seconds.its not long enough for the muscles to relax.This is a neurological this has been studied.and Im not gonna go through the science.of the neurological release.but its all figured out  Bob Sure. And after that 90 seconds.you could go longer than 90 seconds if you want.then youre gonna just relax. Bob Slowly  Slowly.Yep let it come down and then you can wiggle.your ankle up and down.Everythings gentle relaxed youre not going.to get into any of that aggressive.youre not gonna get the roller out.Although there was another study.they combined rolling with. Bob Along with this. Yeah and I dont know the protocol.but they said that was successful too but again. Bob We werent sure if they did the rolling first.or the rolling. No I didnt read the article.but they said theres a combination.Thatll come in time Bob. Bob And I would think thats what I would be doing," Bob and Brad   The two most famous   Physical therapists   On the internet  Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, Physical Therapist.Brad Heineck, Physical Therapist.Together we are the mot famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion, of course, Bob.Today we're gonna talk about calf strains,.knots, that's pain in the calf,.usually the mid calf, right Brad?.Yep.And how to stop that pain in 90 seconds.without painful rolling or deep massage.When we did videos of both of those,.they can be very effective,.but why go through the pain of that.if you don't need to?.We're gonna show you a different option.Right.I think this is gonna be a different tool.in your toolbox.There ya go Bob.So, by the way, if you're new to our Channel,.please take a second to subscribe to us.We provide videos on how to stay healthy, fit,.pain free, and we upload every day.Also, what are we giving away Mike?.Booyah!.Booyah, this is the page.Go to bobandbradcom,.we're always giving something away.This week we're giving away the booyah stick,.Brad's gonna grab one.You can also go to Facebook, it'll be there,.the contest will be pinned.to the top of the page, bobandbrad.Short version of this, go Twitter, Instagram,.or TikTok, and you will get 60 seconds.of Bob and Brad a day.Here's the booyah stick Booyah!.Great for shoulder problems, balance,.what else do we use it for, Brad?.Posture? Posture, Bob.We'll use it for strengthening exer-.A weapon.Yeah, be careful with it Bob.All right, let's go to work, Brad.All right, so calf strain.Very common injury, particularly with people.who walk a lot, run a lot, up and down stairs,.those types of things.And very painful, and they can drag on for a long time,.so how do we get rid of them?.Traditionally, before this episode,.we've done a number of videos.on effective ways to do it.with a cross friction massage,.or the roller Foam roller, yeah.Which we still say, these are good options.They are good options.This option is different, and it doesn't require.the pain that deep rolling does.Or it doesn't require the equipment.There you go Bob, even better.You can do this laying down in your bed actually,.and that's what I would recommend.But you don't have to, you can do it on the floor.Okay.So, I'm just gonna, for those people.who aren't familiar with the rolling,.just a very quick Yeah, a good idea.If you have a knot, right here in your calf,.usually if you have calf pain,.if you palpate or feel in the muscle,.you'll find a ropey tender spot.where it's tight, it's tender,.and that's what we have to roll out.We have to get in there and massage it.with a deep massager, or you can use the roller,.like this, and you could work on it,.go over that.It's a little uncomfortable, but if you work with it,.it can work out, and it's kind of one of those things.that hurts, but it hurts so good.because when you're done, it feels good.Now, the other option that we're gonna talk about.feels good and there's no pain involved.As a matter of fact, it feels good,.good throughout the whole thing.I'm gonna use a pillow, as a matter of fact,.I recommend getting a pillow so you can get.more comfortable.So let's say, with the technique,.'cause we're not gonna keep a secret here,.this is called the positional release,.or back in the day this was.technique-.[Bob] Strain and counter strain.Yeah, it's been around for many years.Decades actually.So, let's say I have a calf strain right here,.and what I'm gonna do is lay like this.Get comfortable, I'm gonna put my foot here.so I can relax.There you go, I'm gonna show a little leg,.don't get excited, ha ha!.Bob, it's not that funny!.So, I'm gonna go in here and just palpate around.Now, the muscle fibers go this way,.so I'm gonna go right to left,.and I work up and down.I'm gonna, usually even if you don't have a strain,.you can find a tender spot right.[Bob] So you're really not treating it right now,.you're just looking for the painful spot?.[Brad] Right, trying to find the source of that-.[Bob] And you already have it on slack a little bit.[Brad] Right.[Bob] Because the knee's bent.[Brad] Right.[Bob] And a lot of people may not know that,.but the calf muscle crosses over the knee.[Brad] Right.[Bob] One of them.[Brad] One of them does, right.Plus, if you look at my ankle,.it's plantar flexed,.so I have the muscle on slack,.and I'm looking for tender spot.[Bob] That's more relaxing.[Brad] Yeah, exactly.Good point Bob.And I can find one right there,.it's kind of on the right hand side a little bit.It may be in the center, it may be here,.it may be down in the soleus muscle,.but you need to find it, and you will.Let's say I'm gonna go to this,.I palpate it, right there it is.I'd give that about a three or a four.when I work over it.[Bob] Okay, on a scale zero to 10.[Brad] Right.[Bob] Or one to ten.[Brad] Yep, so I'm gonna note that.Now, if you've got a real strain,.you're probably gonna be up to around a seven.or an eight when you hit that spot and push on it.[Bob] So again, that's the level of irritation or pain.There you go, and that's,.so you don't do any more of that.That's all the pain you're gonna really feel.in this technique [Bob] Okay.Then you have to go to a position.of maximal relaxation and minimal pain,.so I'm gonna flex the knee.Now this is the part, that as a therapist,.we know that if we flex the knee,.and we plantar flex the foot maximally,.that's gonna shorten the calf muscles up maximally,.and that's what we want.Now, the other trick is,.you may have to take your foot,.I'm gonna lower the knee so you could see it.Either evert it this way or invert it this way,.and the way you know if you're in the right place,.right position, is it feels best.So, in mine, because I don't have an injury.it's hard to say, but I think I could feel.a little best, now if you have an injury,.you'll probably notice it.[Bob] Yeah, you'll probably be able to tell immediately.[Brad] If it's on the outside, it's probably,.if you bring the foot towards that direction,.but you experiment, see where it feels best.And once you find the spot, and then you're.just going to hold and relax,.then you have to time that for 90 seconds,.pardon me, 90 seconds, and just relax.Breathe comfortably, relax.Make sure you clock it at 90 seconds,.don't go less than that.It was real critical with the .[Bob] The timing is really important.Right.If you're gonna hold it for 30 seconds, 45 seconds,.it's not long enough for the muscles to relax.This is a neurological, this has been studied,.and I'm not gonna go through the science.of the neurological release,.but it's all figured out [Bob] Sure.And after that 90 seconds,.you could go longer than 90 seconds if you want,.then you're gonna just relax.[Bob] Slowly Slowly.Yep, let it come down and then you can wiggle.your ankle up and down.Everything's gentle, relaxed, you're not going.to get into any of that aggressive,.you're not gonna get the roller out.Although, there was another study,.they combined rolling with-.[Bob] Along with this.Yeah, and I don't know the protocol,.but they said that was successful too, but again-.[Bob] We weren't sure if they did the rolling first,.or the rolling-.No, I didn't read the article,.but they said there's a combination.That'll come in time, Bob.[Bob] And I would think that's what I would be doing.with this, Brad, I would probably be doing.a combination Combination, sure.I mean, you could try this alone.Yeah.I mean, I have to be honest Brad,.I became a big believer of how this worked.on my hip Sure.And I could definitely tell with my hip flexors,.that they relaxed,.and I don't know if it's a coincidence,.but I don't feel it when I'm running now.There you go.So, I mean-.Oh, we forgot one little part,.piece of information (laughs).I got so excited about-.Sure.After the 90 seconds,.you should go back to that painful spot.[Bob] Oh, and just to see how it's doing.To see did it- Yep,.and then press on it again.Before, I was at a three or a four,.yeah, it's about a one right now.I can still feel it, but it's decreased.It wasn't bad to begin with, but definitely better now.[Bob] And this is to show you that it's working.And to show you it's amazing how just by putting.that muscle in a maximal relaxed position,.that it can actually calm it down.That's how the name counter strain,.you got the strain, typically from a stretch.or an activity like that,.the counter strain is going the opposite.Sure.So, If it was a real injury.and you're at a seven or eight,.you could easily get down to a one or a two.after the 90 seconds.Again, if you have the calf issue,.you're going to be able to tell right away.I wonder if this does work with neuropathy and stuff,.just because you know, there's secondary pain.from neuropathy, that the muscles start to react.Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good point.And so, I mean to be calf pain,.a lot of the times the pain's in the feet and stuff,.but I'm just cogitating,.thinking through all this.Right, well, when we got our spare time,.we'll look into the literature,.and we'll inform you as we find out.And we'll get back to you, so.Remember, Brad and I can fix just about anything.Except for.A broken heart, but we're working on it.Oh Bob, why Bob?.Why the violence with me?","{'(0.36, 2.216)': ' Bob and Brad  , '(2.216, 4.338)': ' The two most

VYXSyQmTAXQ,How you can find the tender spot in your calf?,"(226, 298)",So Im gonna go in here and just palpate around.Now the muscle fibers go this way.so Im gonna go right to left.and I work up and down.Im gonna usually even if you dont have a strain.you can find a tender spot right. Bob So youre really not treating it right now.youre just looking for the painful spot. Brad Right trying to find the source of that. Bob And you already have it on slack a little bit. Brad Right. Bob Because the knees bent. Brad Right. Bob And a lot of people may not know that.but the calf muscle crosses over the knee. Brad Right. Bob One of them. Brad One of them does right.Plus if you look at my ankle.its plantar flexed.so I have the muscle on slack.and Im looking for tender spot. Bob Thats more relaxing. Brad Yeah exactly.Good point Bob.And I can find one right there.its kind of on the right hand side a little bit.It may be in the center it may be here.it may be down in the soleus muscle.but you need to find it and you will.Lets say Im gonna go to this.I palpate it right there it is.Id give that about a three or a four.when I work over it. Bob Okay on a scale zero to 10. Brad Right. Bob Or one to ten. Brad Yep so Im gonna note that.Now if youve got a real strain.youre probably gonna be up to around a seven.or an eight when you hit that spot and push on it. Bob So again thats the level of irritation or pain," Bob and Brad   The two most famous   Physical therapists   On the internet  Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, Physical Therapist.Brad Heineck, Physical Therapist.Together we are the mot famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion, of course, Bob.Today we're gonna talk about calf strains,.knots, that's pain in the calf,.usually the mid calf, right Brad?.Yep.And how to stop that pain in 90 seconds.without painful rolling or deep massage.When we did videos of both of those,.they can be very effective,.but why go through the pain of that.if you don't need to?.We're gonna show you a different option.Right.I think this is gonna be a different tool.in your toolbox.There ya go Bob.So, by the way, if you're new to our Channel,.please take a second to subscribe to us.We provide videos on how to stay healthy, fit,.pain free, and we upload every day.Also, what are we giving away Mike?.Booyah!.Booyah, this is the page.Go to bobandbradcom,.we're always giving something away.This week we're giving away the booyah stick,.Brad's gonna grab one.You can also go to Facebook, it'll be there,.the contest will be pinned.to the top of the page, bobandbrad.Short version of this, go Twitter, Instagram,.or TikTok, and you will get 60 seconds.of Bob and Brad a day.Here's the booyah stick Booyah!.Great for shoulder problems, balance,.what else do we use it for, Brad?.Posture? Posture, Bob.We'll use it for strengthening exer-.A weapon.Yeah, be careful with it Bob.All right, let's go to work, Brad.All right, so calf strain.Very common injury, particularly with people.who walk a lot, run a lot, up and down stairs,.those types of things.And very painful, and they can drag on for a long time,.so how do we get rid of them?.Traditionally, before this episode,.we've done a number of videos.on effective ways to do it.with a cross friction massage,.or the roller Foam roller, yeah.Which we still say, these are good options.They are good options.This option is different, and it doesn't require.the pain that deep rolling does.Or it doesn't require the equipment.There you go Bob, even better.You can do this laying down in your bed actually,.and that's what I would recommend.But you don't have to, you can do it on the floor.Okay.So, I'm just gonna, for those people.who aren't familiar with the rolling,.just a very quick Yeah, a good idea.If you have a knot, right here in your calf,.usually if you have calf pain,.if you palpate or feel in the muscle,.you'll find a ropey tender spot.where it's tight, it's tender,.and that's what we have to roll out.We have to get in there and massage it.with a deep massager, or you can use the roller,.like this, and you could work on it,.go over that.It's a little uncomfortable, but if you work with it,.it can work out, and it's kind of one of those things.that hurts, but it hurts so good.because when you're done, it feels good.Now, the other option that we're gonna talk about.feels good and there's no pain involved.As a matter of fact, it feels good,.good throughout the whole thing.I'm gonna use a pillow, as a matter of fact,.I recommend getting a pillow so you can get.more comfortable.So let's say, with the technique,.'cause we're not gonna keep a secret here,.this is called the positional release,.or back in the day this was.technique-.[Bob] Strain and counter strain.Yeah, it's been around for many years.Decades actually.So, let's say I have a calf strain right here,.and what I'm gonna do is lay like this.Get comfortable, I'm gonna put my foot here.so I can relax.There you go, I'm gonna show a little leg,.don't get excited, ha ha!.Bob, it's not that funny!.So, I'm gonna go in here and just palpate around.Now, the muscle fibers go this way,.so I'm gonna go right to left,.and I work up and down.I'm gonna, usually even if you don't have a strain,.you can find a tender spot right.[Bob] So you're really not treating it right now,.you're just looking for the painful spot?.[Brad] Right, trying to find the source of that-.[Bob] And you already have it on slack a little bit.[Brad] Right.[Bob] Because the knee's bent.[Brad] Right.[Bob] And a lot of people may not know that,.but the calf muscle crosses over the knee.[Brad] Right.[Bob] One of them.[Brad] One of them does, right.Plus, if you look at my ankle,.it's plantar flexed,.so I have the muscle on slack,.and I'm looking for tender spot.[Bob] That's more relaxing.[Brad] Yeah, exactly.Good point Bob.And I can find one right there,.it's kind of on the right hand side a little bit.It may be in the center, it may be here,.it may be down in the soleus muscle,.but you need to find it, and you will.Let's say I'm gonna go to this,.I palpate it, right there it is.I'd give that about a three or a four.when I work over it.[Bob] Okay, on a scale zero to 10.[Brad] Right.[Bob] Or one to ten.[Brad] Yep, so I'm gonna note that.Now, if you've got a real strain,.you're probably gonna be up to around a seven.or an eight when you hit that spot and push on it.[Bob] So again, that's the level of irritation or pain.There you go, and that's,.so you don't do any more of that.That's all the pain you're gonna really feel.in this technique [Bob] Okay.Then you have to go to a position.of maximal relaxation and minimal pain,.so I'm gonna flex the knee.Now this is the part, that as a therapist,.we know that if we flex the knee,.and we plantar flex the foot maximally,.that's gonna shorten the calf muscles up maximally,.and that's what we want.Now, the other trick is,.you may have to take your foot,.I'm gonna lower the knee so you could see it.Either evert it this way or invert it this way,.and the way you know if you're in the right place,.right position, is it feels best.So, in mine, because I don't have an injury.it's hard to say, but I think I could feel.a little best, now if you have an injury,.you'll probably notice it.[Bob] Yeah, you'll probably be able to tell immediately.[Brad] If it's on the outside, it's probably,.if you bring the foot towards that direction,.but you experiment, see where it feels best.And once you find the spot, and then you're.just going to hold and relax,.then you have to time that for 90 seconds,.pardon me, 90 seconds, and just relax.Breathe comfortably, relax.Make sure you clock it at 90 seconds,.don't go less than that.It was real critical with the .[Bob] The timing is really important.Right.If you're gonna hold it for 30 seconds, 45 seconds,.it's not long enough for the muscles to relax.This is a neurological, this has been studied,.and I'm not gonna go through the science.of the neurological release,.but it's all figured out [Bob] Sure.And after that 90 seconds,.you could go longer than 90 seconds if you want,.then you're gonna just relax.[Bob] Slowly Slowly.Yep, let it come down and then you can wiggle.your ankle up and down.Everything's gentle, relaxed, you're not going.to get into any of that aggressive,.you're not gonna get the roller out.Although, there was another study,.they combined rolling with-.[Bob] Along with this.Yeah, and I don't know the protocol,.but they said that was successful too, but again-.[Bob] We weren't sure if they did the rolling first,.or the rolling-.No, I didn't read the article,.but they said there's a combination.That'll come in time, Bob.[Bob] And I would think that's what I would be doing.with this, Brad, I would probably be doing.a combination Combination, sure.I mean, you could try this alone.Yeah.I mean, I have to be honest Brad,.I became a big believer of how this worked.on my hip Sure.And I could definitely tell with my hip flexors,.that they relaxed,.and I don't know if it's a coincidence,.but I don't feel it when I'm running now.There you go.So, I mean-.Oh, we forgot one little part,.piece of information (laughs).I got so excited about-.Sure.After the 90 seconds,.you should go back to that painful spot.[Bob] Oh, and just to see how it's doing.To see did it- Yep,.and then press on it again.Before, I was at a three or a four,.yeah, it's about a one right now.I can still feel it, but it's decreased.It wasn't bad to begin with, but definitely better now.[Bob] And this is to show you that it's working.And to show you it's amazing how just by putting.that muscle in a maximal relaxed position,.that it can actually calm it down.That's how the name counter strain,.you got the strain, typically from a stretch.or an activity like that,.the counter strain is going the opposite.Sure.So, If it was a real injury.and you're at a seven or eight,.you could easily get down to a one or a two.after the 90 seconds.Again, if you have the calf issue,.you're going to be able to tell right away.I wonder if this does work with neuropathy and stuff,.just because you know, there's secondary pain.from neuropathy, that the muscles start to react.Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good point.And so, I mean to be calf pain,.a lot of the times the pain's in the feet and stuff,.but I'm just cogitating,.thinking through all this.Right, well, when we got our spare time,.we'll look into the literature,.and we'll inform you as we find out.And we'll get back to you, so.Remember, Brad and I can fix just about anything.Except for.A broken heart, but we're working on it.Oh Bob, why Bob?.Why the violence with me?","{'(0.36, 2.216)': ' Bob and Brad  , '(2.216, 4.338)': ' The two most

CEgMHaXGhmQ,How can I do 90 90 stretches with a hip or pelvic tilt to fix a short leg?,"(73, 208)",going to do.is lay flat on my back im going to go.next to a wall or a.door and put my legs at 90 degrees from.the knee so i should say the hip the.knees and the ankles should be at 90.degrees.plant your feet firmly against that door.of the wall what im going to do.is just simply tilt my pelvis.back so im kind of like tucking my.tailbone in and then im just going to.lift it up off the floor.you can kind of see how theres a nice.space in between there.i try to put my weight at the heels and.from there you should already start to.feel everything activate across the hips.and across the pelvis.what i want to do from here is i want to.hike.one side up so what im going to do is.im going to.tilt my right side like this up just a.little bit.and when you do this youre going to.notice that one knee.in this case whatever side youre.tilting up that sides knee is going to.be.slightly higher than the other so when.im looking at my knees right now.i can notice that right side a little.bit higher up.that means that youre in a good.position when i do this what im going.to do.is im going to then take my left sides.heel.and im going to drive downwards into.the door so im not pressing forward.into it im kind of.pressing down and when i do this i tend.to find that wearing shoes with grip.works a little bit better and when you.do this youre going to feel the.hamstring on that left side.really start to fire what i want to do.from there is i want to take my right.leg off and im just going to simply.march that right leg and stabilize with.the left.when you do this youre going to feel a.lot of muscle starting to fire.across the back the leg the hamstring.into the pelvis the glutes the buttocks.you name it.its a good way to help build.coordination.and really strengthen those muscles that.are associated with that left leg.i try to do this 15 times very.very slowly and then from there what im.going to do is im just going to relax.take a bit of a breather and then from.there im just going to repeat this.three times on both sides its going to.be important to do it on both.sides because at that point youre going.to keep everything balanced.across the lower back and hopefully.bring that short leg back up.into balance so a big cause of a pelvic,in this video i'm going to show you how.to self-fix a.short leg at home stay tuned.hey everyone dr rowe here at spike here.in st joseph michigan.so if you're dealing with a leg length.discrepancy especially if one side.feels shorter than the other then this.is a video that you're not going to want.to miss.i'm going to go over safe effective.stretches and exercises.that will help target a short leg and.the great part is you can do them in the.comfort of your own home.as a side note this is not going to help.correct an anatomical short leg this is.just for something where your hips.maybe your pelvis feels like it's hiked.up or just unlevel.so let's get started with them and.target that short leg and get it gone.right now so all of these exercises are.going to help activate the muscles.around the hips around the pelvis legs.and the low back that are commonly.associated with that short leg so give.all of them a try and make sure to go.with the ones that you feel.help you the most great part is we're.not going to be using any special.equipment either.the first one is called a 90 90 stretch.with a hip or pelvic tilt so what i'm.going to do.is lay flat on my back i'm going to go.next to a wall or a.door and put my legs at 90 degrees from.the knee so i should say the hip the.knees and the ankles should be at 90.degrees.plant your feet firmly against that door.of the wall what i'm going to do.is just simply tilt my pelvis.back so i'm kind of like tucking my.tailbone in and then i'm just going to.lift it up off the floor.you can kind of see how there's a nice.space in between there.i try to put my weight at the heels and.from there you should already start to.feel everything activate across the hips.and across the pelvis.what i want to do from here is i want to.hike.one side up so what i'm going to do is.i'm going to.tilt my right side like this up just a.little bit.and when you do this you're going to.notice that one knee.in this case whatever side you're.tilting up that side's knee is going to.be.slightly higher than the other so when.i'm looking at my knees right now.i can notice that right side a little.bit higher up.that means that you're in a good.position when i do this what i'm going.to do.is i'm going to then take my left side's.heel.and i'm going to drive downwards into.the door so i'm not pressing forward.into it i'm kind of.pressing down and when i do this i tend.to find that wearing shoes with grip.works a little bit better and when you.do this you're going to feel the.hamstring on that left side.really start to fire what i want to do.from there is i want to take my right.leg off and i'm just going to simply.march that right leg and stabilize with.the left.when you do this you're going to feel a.lot of muscle starting to fire.across the back the leg the hamstring.into the pelvis the glutes the buttocks.you name it.it's a good way to help build.coordination.and really strengthen those muscles that.are associated with that left leg.i try to do this 15 times very.very slowly and then from there what i'm.going to do is i'm just going to relax.take a bit of a breather and then from.there i'm just going to repeat this.three times on both sides it's going to.be important to do it on both.sides because at that point you're going.to keep everything balanced.across the lower back and hopefully.bring that short leg back up.into balance so a big cause of a pelvic.tilt that may.result in a short leg is due to glute or.buttock weakness.so what we need to do is strengthen them.to level that off and correct that short.leg and we can do that with a very.simple.exercise called a wall push let's go.next to a wall.and i'm going to space my body just.slightly away from the wall let's take.the arm closest to that wall place it.against it.to anchor us in so my shoulder my elbow.my arm.are firmly against that wall what i'm.going to do is whatever hip.is closest to the wall let's lift that.leg up till.it is nice and parallel with the floor.so the top of the leg should be parallel.with the floor.what i'm going to do from there is take.that knee and drive it.into the wall when you do this try to.press into it with your knee.and you're going to feel a very good uh.pretty much contraction.into the left side's glute so my right.knee is pressing in you're going to feel.it on the left side.the more that you press into it the more.it's going to activate that glute muscle.only go to your comfort level try to.hold this.for about 15 seconds you're just going.to relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five.times from there what i want to do is.then raise the knee up.even further so my knee is above my hip.and then i'm going to repeat this.process this is going to.activate that glute even more what you.want to do 15 second holds to your.comfort level.relax and then repeat up to.five times again it's important to then.switch to the opposite side.to keep everything in balance so this.next one is a great isometric.exercise that is going to help more or.less reset the pelvis.including the sacroiliac or si joints.i'm going to be using my.sturdy beat up broomstick right here if.you don't have a broomstick grab a stick.off a toilet plunger if you don't have.that.go out in the yard and grab a stick it.just needs to be long.and sturdy we're going to start off on a.flat surface you could do this in bed or.on the floor what i want to do is take.our stick and i'm going to place it in.between.my legs like this so one side of the.stick is going to be.above the knee while the other side is.going to be behind the knee.in this case it's behind my right knee.above my left.let's lift the legs up like this and.what i'm going to do.is whatever knee is away from you or i.should say behind the stick.we're going to drive that forward.towards us while the.knee that is closest to you or above the.stick is going to drive away so almost.like a.scissored stance when you do this you're.going to feel a very good.stretch into the lower back the pelvis.the glutes the buttock.only go to your comfort level you want.to hold this.to a comfortable point if it does feel.like it's causing discomfort please.discontinue.but do this for 15 seconds you're just.going to relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five.times and then from there you're just.going to simply.switch and do that on both sides to keep.everything in balance so the second part.of this and this is the part that.everybody likes because it usually.results in a.pop into the si joints is to take your.hands.put them together like this into a fist.lift your legs up like this.put them in between the knees and then.drive your knees.into actually i don't know if you heard.that on the microphone that popped.really well.into your hands that generally will get.those si.joints to pop crack or self-release.afterwards.just check everything especially those.short legs or the pelvic tilt and see if.it has improved it.so this is one of my personal favorite.ways to correct.pelvic tilt that might be causing a.short leg.what i'm going to be doing is using a.yoga block if you don't have a yoga.block you can use a stack of books you.can also.just roll up a large bath towel i'm also.going to be using.my broomstick for stabilization but if.you don't have one.you can go right next to a wall instead.and you can also do this on a staircase.if you find that you find a spot that.this will accommodate you so i'm just.going to put.one leg up on or i should say one foot.up on the yoga block like this while the.other one just goes off.let's straighten both legs as much as.possible.and what i'm going to do from there is.whatever side that is not on that yoga.block.let's just slowly start to lower it down.towards the floor just like this when.you do this you're going to feel a lot.of muscle starting to be engaged.in the lower back across the hips the.pelvis into the legs.only go to your comfort level but just.keep going down as far as you feel.comfortable going when you get to a.point where it's a very deep stretch.hold this for about five seconds and.then what you're going to do is slowly.start to then come back.up and do the opposite let's hike this.hip.up as much as we can it's going to fire.those muscles just a little bit.differently.keep going up until you feel those.muscles.really fire hold this for five seconds.and then you're just going to simply.relax for a second and then repeat this.up to five times how we can engage the.muscles in a 360 degree.fashion is let's do this let's take the.leg.and straighten it the one that's off.that yoga block toes are going to be.pointed up towards the ceiling.from there what i'm going to do is i'm.just going to again slowly start to.lower that side down as much as we feel.comfortable.and then from there once we feel a very.good stretch hold this one for about.five seconds.you're just going to relax and then.you're just going to again.hike that hip up as much as you can five.second holds.relax do it five times you can also just.switch.this broomstick to the opposite side and.then do a.side pose also and this one can be very.very tricky so very go very comfortable.i should say only go to your comfort.level what i'm doing is i'm just.lowering that down as much as i can.and then from there i'm going to hike.that hip up as much as i can holding for.five seconds.and then doing five complete repetitions.and the last one you can do.is straighten the leg right here put the.toes down towards the floor.and this one you're probably going to.end up touching the floor that's fine.but just lower the toes down towards the.floor.and do a light tap and then from there.just.hike that hip up on the side holding for.about five seconds.relaxing and then doing five complete.repetitions when you do this always make.sure to switch over to the opposite side.to make sure all of the muscles are kept.in balance that will ensure.that we're trying to level it off the.best that we can so if you liked the.video and got a lot of relief please.show us your support by giving this.video a like and maybe subscribing to.our channel too if you have any comments.or

CEgMHaXGhmQ,How to do wall push exercise to strengthen the buttock?,"(223, 306)",simple.exercise called a wall push lets go.next to a wall.and im going to space my body just.slightly away from the wall lets take.the arm closest to that wall place it.against it.to anchor us in so my shoulder my elbow.my arm.are firmly against that wall what im.going to do is whatever hip.is closest to the wall lets lift that.leg up till.it is nice and parallel with the floor.so the top of the leg should be parallel.with the floor.what im going to do from there is take.that knee and drive it.into the wall when you do this try to.press into it with your knee.and youre going to feel a very good uh.pretty much contraction.into the left sides glute so my right.knee is pressing in youre going to feel.it on the left side.the more that you press into it the more.its going to activate that glute muscle.only go to your comfort level try to.hold this.for about 15 seconds youre just going.to relax.and then youre going to repeat this up.to five.times from there what i want to do is.then raise the knee up.even further so my knee is above my hip.and then im going to repeat this.process this is going to.activate that glute even more what you.want to do 15 second holds to your.comfort level.relax and then repeat up to.five times again its important to then.switch to the opposite side.to keep everything in balance so this,in this video i'm going to show you how.to self-fix a.short leg at home stay tuned.hey everyone dr rowe here at spike here.in st joseph michigan.so if you're dealing with a leg length.discrepancy especially if one side.feels shorter than the other then this.is a video that you're not going to want.to miss.i'm going to go over safe effective.stretches and exercises.that will help target a short leg and.the great part is you can do them in the.comfort of your own home.as a side note this is not going to help.correct an anatomical short leg this is.just for something where your hips.maybe your pelvis feels like it's hiked.up or just unlevel.so let's get started with them and.target that short leg and get it gone.right now so all of these exercises are.going to help activate the muscles.around the hips around the pelvis legs.and the low back that are commonly.associated with that short leg so give.all of them a try and make sure to go.with the ones that you feel.help you the most great part is we're.not going to be using any special.equipment either.the first one is called a 90 90 stretch.with a hip or pelvic tilt so what i'm.going to do.is lay flat on my back i'm going to go.next to a wall or a.door and put my legs at 90 degrees from.the knee so i should say the hip the.knees and the ankles should be at 90.degrees.plant your feet firmly against that door.of the wall what i'm going to do.is just simply tilt my pelvis.back so i'm kind of like tucking my.tailbone in and then i'm just going to.lift it up off the floor.you can kind of see how there's a nice.space in between there.i try to put my weight at the heels and.from there you should already start to.feel everything activate across the hips.and across the pelvis.what i want to do from here is i want to.hike.one side up so what i'm going to do is.i'm going to.tilt my right side like this up just a.little bit.and when you do this you're going to.notice that one knee.in this case whatever side you're.tilting up that side's knee is going to.be.slightly higher than the other so when.i'm looking at my knees right now.i can notice that right side a little.bit higher up.that means that you're in a good.position when i do this what i'm going.to do.is i'm going to then take my left side's.heel.and i'm going to drive downwards into.the door so i'm not pressing forward.into it i'm kind of.pressing down and when i do this i tend.to find that wearing shoes with grip.works a little bit better and when you.do this you're going to feel the.hamstring on that left side.really start to fire what i want to do.from there is i want to take my right.leg off and i'm just going to simply.march that right leg and stabilize with.the left.when you do this you're going to feel a.lot of muscle starting to fire.across the back the leg the hamstring.into the pelvis the glutes the buttocks.you name it.it's a good way to help build.coordination.and really strengthen those muscles that.are associated with that left leg.i try to do this 15 times very.very slowly and then from there what i'm.going to do is i'm just going to relax.take a bit of a breather and then from.there i'm just going to repeat this.three times on both sides it's going to.be important to do it on both.sides because at that point you're going.to keep everything balanced.across the lower back and hopefully.bring that short leg back up.into balance so a big cause of a pelvic.tilt that may.result in a short leg is due to glute or.buttock weakness.so what we need to do is strengthen them.to level that off and correct that short.leg and we can do that with a very.simple.exercise called a wall push let's go.next to a wall.and i'm going to space my body just.slightly away from the wall let's take.the arm closest to that wall place it.against it.to anchor us in so my shoulder my elbow.my arm.are firmly against that wall what i'm.going to do is whatever hip.is closest to the wall let's lift that.leg up till.it is nice and parallel with the floor.so the top of the leg should be parallel.with the floor.what i'm going to do from there is take.that knee and drive it.into the wall when you do this try to.press into it with your knee.and you're going to feel a very good uh.pretty much contraction.into the left side's glute so my right.knee is pressing in you're going to feel.it on the left side.the more that you press into it the more.it's going to activate that glute muscle.only go to your comfort level try to.hold this.for about 15 seconds you're just going.to relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five.times from there what i want to do is.then raise the knee up.even further so my knee is above my hip.and then i'm going to repeat this.process this is going to.activate that glute even more what you.want to do 15 second holds to your.comfort level.relax and then repeat up to.five times again it's important to then.switch to the opposite side.to keep everything in balance so this.next one is a great isometric.exercise that is going to help more or.less reset the pelvis.including the sacroiliac or si joints.i'm going to be using my.sturdy beat up broomstick right here if.you don't have a broomstick grab a stick.off a toilet plunger if you don't have.that.go out in the yard and grab a stick it.just needs to be long.and sturdy we're going to start off on a.flat surface you could do this in bed or.on the floor what i want to do is take.our stick and i'm going to place it in.between.my legs like this so one side of the.stick is going to be.above the knee while the other side is.going to be behind the knee.in this case it's behind my right knee.above my left.let's lift the legs up like this and.what i'm going to do.is whatever knee is away from you or i.should say behind the stick.we're going to drive that forward.towards us while the.knee that is closest to you or above the.stick is going to drive away so almost.like a.scissored stance when you do this you're.going to feel a very good.stretch into the lower back the pelvis.the glutes the buttock.only go to your comfort level you want.to hold this.to a comfortable point if it does feel.like it's causing discomfort please.discontinue.but do this for 15 seconds you're just.going to relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five.times and then from there you're just.going to simply.switch and do that on both sides to keep.everything in balance so the second part.of this and this is the part that.everybody likes because it usually.results in a.pop into the si joints is to take your.hands.put them together like this into a fist.lift your legs up like this.put them in between the knees and then.drive your knees.into actually i don't know if you heard.that on the microphone that popped.really well.into your hands that generally will get.those si.joints to pop crack or self-release.afterwards.just check everything especially those.short legs or the pelvic tilt and see if.it has improved it.so this is one of my personal favorite.ways to correct.pelvic tilt that might be causing a.short leg.what i'm going to be doing is using a.yoga block if you don't have a yoga.block you can use a stack of books you.can also.just roll up a large bath towel i'm also.going to be using.my broomstick for stabilization but if.you don't have one.you can go right next to a wall instead.and you can also do this on a staircase.if you find that you find a spot that.this will accommodate you so i'm just.going to put.one leg up on or i should say one foot.up on the yoga block like this while the.other one just goes off.let's straighten both legs as much as.possible.and what i'm going to do from there is.whatever side that is not on that yoga.block.let's just slowly start to lower it down.towards the floor just like this when.you do this you're going to feel a lot.of muscle starting to be engaged.in the lower back across the hips the.pelvis into the legs.only go to your comfort level but just.keep going down as far as you feel.comfortable going when you get to a.point where it's a very deep stretch.hold this for about five seconds and.then what you're going to do is slowly.start to then come back.up and do the opposite let's hike this.hip.up as much as we can it's going to fire.those muscles just a little bit.differently.keep going up until you feel those.muscles.really fire hold this for five seconds.and then you're just going to simply.relax for a second and then repeat this.up to five times how we can engage the.muscles in a 360 degree.fashion is let's do this let's take the.leg.and straighten it the one that's off.that yoga block toes are going to be.pointed up towards the ceiling.from there what i'm going to do is i'm.just going to again slowly start to.lower that side down as much as we feel.comfortable.and then from there once we feel a very.good stretch hold this one for about.five seconds.you're just going to relax and then.you're just going to again.hike that hip up as much as you can five.second holds.relax do it five times you can also just.switch.this broomstick to the opposite side and.then do a.side pose also and this one can be very.very tricky so very go very comfortable.i should say only go to your comfort.level what i'm doing is i'm just.lowering that down as much as i can.and then from there i'm going to hike.that hip up as much as i can holding for.five seconds.and then doing five complete repetitions.and the last one you can do.is straighten the leg right here put the.toes down towards the floor.and this one you're probably going to.end up touching the floor that's fine.but just lower the toes down towards the.floor.and do a light tap and then from there.just.hike that hip up on the side holding for.about five seconds.relaxing and then doing five complete.repetitions when you do this always make.sure to switch over to the opposite side.to make sure all of the muscles are kept.in balance that will ensure.that we're trying to level it off the.best that we can so if you liked the.video and got a lot of relief please.show us your support by giving this.video a like and maybe subscribing to.our

CEgMHaXGhmQ,How can I do isometric exercise to reset the pelvis?,"(314, 397)",less reset the pelvis.including the sacroiliac or si joints.im going to be using my.sturdy beat up broomstick right here if.you dont have a broomstick grab a stick.off a toilet plunger if you dont have.that.go out in the yard and grab a stick it.just needs to be long.and sturdy were going to start off on a.flat surface you could do this in bed or.on the floor what i want to do is take.our stick and im going to place it in.between.my legs like this so one side of the.stick is going to be.above the knee while the other side is.going to be behind the knee.in this case its behind my right knee.above my left.lets lift the legs up like this and.what im going to do.is whatever knee is away from you or i.should say behind the stick.were going to drive that forward.towards us while the.knee that is closest to you or above the.stick is going to drive away so almost.like a.scissored stance when you do this youre.going to feel a very good.stretch into the lower back the pelvis.the glutes the buttock.only go to your comfort level you want.to hold this.to a comfortable point if it does feel.like its causing discomfort please.discontinue.but do this for 15 seconds youre just.going to relax.and then youre going to repeat this up.to five.times and then from there youre just.going to simply.switch and do that on both sides to keep.everything in balance so the second part,in this video i'm going to show you how.to self-fix a.short leg at home stay tuned.hey everyone dr rowe here at spike here.in st joseph michigan.so if you're dealing with a leg length.discrepancy especially if one side.feels shorter than the other then this.is a video that you're not going to want.to miss.i'm going to go over safe effective.stretches and exercises.that will help target a short leg and.the great part is you can do them in the.comfort of your own home.as a side note this is not going to help.correct an anatomical short leg this is.just for something where your hips.maybe your pelvis feels like it's hiked.up or just unlevel.so let's get started with them and.target that short leg and get it gone.right now so all of these exercises are.going to help activate the muscles.around the hips around the pelvis legs.and the low back that are commonly.associated with that short leg so give.all of them a try and make sure to go.with the ones that you feel.help you the most great part is we're.not going to be using any special.equipment either.the first one is called a 90 90 stretch.with a hip or pelvic tilt so what i'm.going to do.is lay flat on my back i'm going to go.next to a wall or a.door and put my legs at 90 degrees from.the knee so i should say the hip the.knees and the ankles should be at 90.degrees.plant your feet firmly against that door.of the wall what i'm going to do.is just simply tilt my pelvis.back so i'm kind of like tucking my.tailbone in and then i'm just going to.lift it up off the floor.you can kind of see how there's a nice.space in between there.i try to put my weight at the heels and.from there you should already start to.feel everything activate across the hips.and across the pelvis.what i want to do from here is i want to.hike.one side up so what i'm going to do is.i'm going to.tilt my right side like this up just a.little bit.and when you do this you're going to.notice that one knee.in this case whatever side you're.tilting up that side's knee is going to.be.slightly higher than the other so when.i'm looking at my knees right now.i can notice that right side a little.bit higher up.that means that you're in a good.position when i do this what i'm going.to do.is i'm going to then take my left side's.heel.and i'm going to drive downwards into.the door so i'm not pressing forward.into it i'm kind of.pressing down and when i do this i tend.to find that wearing shoes with grip.works a little bit better and when you.do this you're going to feel the.hamstring on that left side.really start to fire what i want to do.from there is i want to take my right.leg off and i'm just going to simply.march that right leg and stabilize with.the left.when you do this you're going to feel a.lot of muscle starting to fire.across the back the leg the hamstring.into the pelvis the glutes the buttocks.you name it.it's a good way to help build.coordination.and really strengthen those muscles that.are associated with that left leg.i try to do this 15 times very.very slowly and then from there what i'm.going to do is i'm just going to relax.take a bit of a breather and then from.there i'm just going to repeat this.three times on both sides it's going to.be important to do it on both.sides because at that point you're going.to keep everything balanced.across the lower back and hopefully.bring that short leg back up.into balance so a big cause of a pelvic.tilt that may.result in a short leg is due to glute or.buttock weakness.so what we need to do is strengthen them.to level that off and correct that short.leg and we can do that with a very.simple.exercise called a wall push let's go.next to a wall.and i'm going to space my body just.slightly away from the wall let's take.the arm closest to that wall place it.against it.to anchor us in so my shoulder my elbow.my arm.are firmly against that wall what i'm.going to do is whatever hip.is closest to the wall let's lift that.leg up till.it is nice and parallel with the floor.so the top of the leg should be parallel.with the floor.what i'm going to do from there is take.that knee and drive it.into the wall when you do this try to.press into it with your knee.and you're going to feel a very good uh.pretty much contraction.into the left side's glute so my right.knee is pressing in you're going to feel.it on the left side.the more that you press into it the more.it's going to activate that glute muscle.only go to your comfort level try to.hold this.for about 15 seconds you're just going.to relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five.times from there what i want to do is.then raise the knee up.even further so my knee is above my hip.and then i'm going to repeat this.process this is going to.activate that glute even more what you.want to do 15 second holds to your.comfort level.relax and then repeat up to.five times again it's important to then.switch to the opposite side.to keep everything in balance so this.next one is a great isometric.exercise that is going to help more or.less reset the pelvis.including the sacroiliac or si joints.i'm going to be using my.sturdy beat up broomstick right here if.you don't have a broomstick grab a stick.off a toilet plunger if you don't have.that.go out in the yard and grab a stick it.just needs to be long.and sturdy we're going to start off on a.flat surface you could do this in bed or.on the floor what i want to do is take.our stick and i'm going to place it in.between.my legs like this so one side of the.stick is going to be.above the knee while the other side is.going to be behind the knee.in this case it's behind my right knee.above my left.let's lift the legs up like this and.what i'm going to do.is whatever knee is away from you or i.should say behind the stick.we're going to drive that forward.towards us while the.knee that is closest to you or above the.stick is going to drive away so almost.like a.scissored stance when you do this you're.going to feel a very good.stretch into the lower back the pelvis.the glutes the buttock.only go to your comfort level you want.to hold this.to a comfortable point if it does feel.like it's causing discomfort please.discontinue.but do this for 15 seconds you're just.going to relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five.times and then from there you're just.going to simply.switch and do that on both sides to keep.everything in balance so the second part.of this and this is the part that.everybody likes because it usually.results in a.pop into the si joints is to take your.hands.put them together like this into a fist.lift your legs up like this.put them in between the knees and then.drive your knees.into actually i don't know if you heard.that on the microphone that popped.really well.into your hands that generally will get.those si.joints to pop crack or self-release.afterwards.just check everything especially those.short legs or the pelvic tilt and see if.it has improved it.so this is one of my personal favorite.ways to correct.pelvic tilt that might be causing a.short leg.what i'm going to be doing is using a.yoga block if you don't have a yoga.block you can use a stack of books you.can also.just roll up a large bath towel i'm also.going to be using.my broomstick for stabilization but if.you don't have one.you can go right next to a wall instead.and you can also do this on a staircase.if you find that you find a spot that.this will accommodate you so i'm just.going to put.one leg up on or i should say one foot.up on the yoga block like this while the.other one just goes off.let's straighten both legs as much as.possible.and what i'm going to do from there is.whatever side that is not on that yoga.block.let's just slowly start to lower it down.towards the floor just like this when.you do this you're going to feel a lot.of muscle starting to be engaged.in the lower back across the hips the.pelvis into the legs.only go to your comfort level but just.keep going down as far as you feel.comfortable going when you get to a.point where it's a very deep stretch.hold this for about five seconds and.then what you're going to do is slowly.start to then come back.up and do the opposite let's hike this.hip.up as much as we can it's going to fire.those muscles just a little bit.differently.keep going up until you feel those.muscles.really fire hold this for five seconds.and then you're just going to simply.relax for a second and then repeat this.up to five times how we can engage the.muscles in a 360 degree.fashion is let's do this let's take the.leg.and straighten it the one that's off.that yoga block toes are going to be.pointed up towards the ceiling.from there what i'm going to do is i'm.just going to again slowly start to.lower that side down as much as we feel.comfortable.and then from there once we feel a very.good stretch hold this one for about.five seconds.you're just going to relax and then.you're just going to again.hike that hip up as much as you can five.second holds.relax do it five times you can also just.switch.this broomstick to the opposite side and.then do a.side pose also and this one can be very.very tricky so very go very comfortable.i should say only go to your comfort.level what i'm doing is i'm just.lowering that down as much as i can.and then from there i'm going to hike.that hip up as much as i can holding for.five seconds.and then doing five complete repetitions.and the last one you can do.is straighten the leg right here put the.toes down towards the floor.and this one you're probably going to.end up touching the floor that's fine.but just lower the toes down towards the.floor.and do a light tap and then from there.just.hike that hip up on the side holding for.about five seconds.relaxing and then doing five complete.repetitions when you do this always make.sure to switch over to the opposite side.to make sure all of the muscles are kept.in balance that will ensure.that we're trying to level it off the.best that we can so if you liked the.video and got a lot of relief please.show us your support by giving this.video a like and maybe subscribing to.our channel too if you have any comments.or questions please leave them below.i'll get back to you as soon as i

CEgMHaXGhmQ,How can I do exercise that can help my S.I. joints?,"(403, 428)",results in a.pop into the si joints is to take your.hands.put them together like this into a fist.lift your legs up like this.put them in between the knees and then.drive your knees.into actually i dont know if you heard.that on the microphone that popped.really well.into your hands that generally will get.those si.joints to pop crack or selfrelease.afterwards.just check everything especially those.short legs or the pelvic tilt and see if.it has improved it,in this video i'm going to show you how.to self-fix a.short leg at home stay tuned.hey everyone dr rowe here at spike here.in st joseph michigan.so if you're dealing with a leg length.discrepancy especially if one side.feels shorter than the other then this.is a video that you're not going to want.to miss.i'm going to go over safe effective.stretches and exercises.that will help target a short leg and.the great part is you can do them in the.comfort of your own home.as a side note this is not going to help.correct an anatomical short leg this is.just for something where your hips.maybe your pelvis feels like it's hiked.up or just unlevel.so let's get started with them and.target that short leg and get it gone.right now so all of these exercises are.going to help activate the muscles.around the hips around the pelvis legs.and the low back that are commonly.associated with that short leg so give.all of them a try and make sure to go.with the ones that you feel.help you the most great part is we're.not going to be using any special.equipment either.the first one is called a 90 90 stretch.with a hip or pelvic tilt so what i'm.going to do.is lay flat on my back i'm going to go.next to a wall or a.door and put my legs at 90 degrees from.the knee so i should say the hip the.knees and the ankles should be at 90.degrees.plant your feet firmly against that door.of the wall what i'm going to do.is just simply tilt my pelvis.back so i'm kind of like tucking my.tailbone in and then i'm just going to.lift it up off the floor.you can kind of see how there's a nice.space in between there.i try to put my weight at the heels and.from there you should already start to.feel everything activate across the hips.and across the pelvis.what i want to do from here is i want to.hike.one side up so what i'm going to do is.i'm going to.tilt my right side like this up just a.little bit.and when you do this you're going to.notice that one knee.in this case whatever side you're.tilting up that side's knee is going to.be.slightly higher than the other so when.i'm looking at my knees right now.i can notice that right side a little.bit higher up.that means that you're in a good.position when i do this what i'm going.to do.is i'm going to then take my left side's.heel.and i'm going to drive downwards into.the door so i'm not pressing forward.into it i'm kind of.pressing down and when i do this i tend.to find that wearing shoes with grip.works a little bit better and when you.do this you're going to feel the.hamstring on that left side.really start to fire what i want to do.from there is i want to take my right.leg off and i'm just going to simply.march that right leg and stabilize with.the left.when you do this you're going to feel a.lot of muscle starting to fire.across the back the leg the hamstring.into the pelvis the glutes the buttocks.you name it.it's a good way to help build.coordination.and really strengthen those muscles that.are associated with that left leg.i try to do this 15 times very.very slowly and then from there what i'm.going to do is i'm just going to relax.take a bit of a breather and then from.there i'm just going to repeat this.three times on both sides it's going to.be important to do it on both.sides because at that point you're going.to keep everything balanced.across the lower back and hopefully.bring that short leg back up.into balance so a big cause of a pelvic.tilt that may.result in a short leg is due to glute or.buttock weakness.so what we need to do is strengthen them.to level that off and correct that short.leg and we can do that with a very.simple.exercise called a wall push let's go.next to a wall.and i'm going to space my body just.slightly away from the wall let's take.the arm closest to that wall place it.against it.to anchor us in so my shoulder my elbow.my arm.are firmly against that wall what i'm.going to do is whatever hip.is closest to the wall let's lift that.leg up till.it is nice and parallel with the floor.so the top of the leg should be parallel.with the floor.what i'm going to do from there is take.that knee and drive it.into the wall when you do this try to.press into it with your knee.and you're going to feel a very good uh.pretty much contraction.into the left side's glute so my right.knee is pressing in you're going to feel.it on the left side.the more that you press into it the more.it's going to activate that glute muscle.only go to your comfort level try to.hold this.for about 15 seconds you're just going.to relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five.times from there what i want to do is.then raise the knee up.even further so my knee is above my hip.and then i'm going to repeat this.process this is going to.activate that glute even more what you.want to do 15 second holds to your.comfort level.relax and then repeat up to.five times again it's important to then.switch to the opposite side.to keep everything in balance so this.next one is a great isometric.exercise that is going to help more or.less reset the pelvis.including the sacroiliac or si joints.i'm going to be using my.sturdy beat up broomstick right here if.you don't have a broomstick grab a stick.off a toilet plunger if you don't have.that.go out in the yard and grab a stick it.just needs to be long.and sturdy we're going to start off on a.flat surface you could do this in bed or.on the floor what i want to do is take.our stick and i'm going to place it in.between.my legs like this so one side of the.stick is going to be.above the knee while the other side is.going to be behind the knee.in this case it's behind my right knee.above my left.let's lift the legs up like this and.what i'm going to do.is whatever knee is away from you or i.should say behind the stick.we're going to drive that forward.towards us while the.knee that is closest to you or above the.stick is going to drive away so almost.like a.scissored stance when you do this you're.going to feel a very good.stretch into the lower back the pelvis.the glutes the buttock.only go to your comfort level you want.to hold this.to a comfortable point if it does feel.like it's causing discomfort please.discontinue.but do this for 15 seconds you're just.going to relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five.times and then from there you're just.going to simply.switch and do that on both sides to keep.everything in balance so the second part.of this and this is the part that.everybody likes because it usually.results in a.pop into the si joints is to take your.hands.put them together like this into a fist.lift your legs up like this.put them in between the knees and then.drive your knees.into actually i don't know if you heard.that on the microphone that popped.really well.into your hands that generally will get.those si.joints to pop crack or self-release.afterwards.just check everything especially those.short legs or the pelvic tilt and see if.it has improved it.so this is one of my personal favorite.ways to correct.pelvic tilt that might be causing a.short leg.what i'm going to be doing is using a.yoga block if you don't have a yoga.block you can use a stack of books you.can also.just roll up a large bath towel i'm also.going to be using.my broomstick for stabilization but if.you don't have one.you can go right next to a wall instead.and you can also do this on a staircase.if you find that you find a spot that.this will accommodate you so i'm just.going to put.one leg up on or i should say one foot.up on the yoga block like this while the.other one just goes off.let's straighten both legs as much as.possible.and what i'm going to do from there is.whatever side that is not on that yoga.block.let's just slowly start to lower it down.towards the floor just like this when.you do this you're going to feel a lot.of muscle starting to be engaged.in the lower back across the hips the.pelvis into the legs.only go to your comfort level but just.keep going down as far as you feel.comfortable going when you get to a.point where it's a very deep stretch.hold this for about five seconds and.then what you're going to do is slowly.start to then come back.up and do the opposite let's hike this.hip.up as much as we can it's going to fire.those muscles just a little bit.differently.keep going up until you feel those.muscles.really fire hold this for five seconds.and then you're just going to simply.relax for a second and then repeat this.up to five times how we can engage the.muscles in a 360 degree.fashion is let's do this let's take the.leg.and straighten it the one that's off.that yoga block toes are going to be.pointed up towards the ceiling.from there what i'm going to do is i'm.just going to again slowly start to.lower that side down as much as we feel.comfortable.and then from there once we feel a very.good stretch hold this one for about.five seconds.you're just going to relax and then.you're just going to again.hike that hip up as much as you can five.second holds.relax do it five times you can also just.switch.this broomstick to the opposite side and.then do a.side pose also and this one can be very.very tricky so very go very comfortable.i should say only go to your comfort.level what i'm doing is i'm just.lowering that down as much as i can.and then from there i'm going to hike.that hip up as much as i can holding for.five seconds.and then doing five complete repetitions.and the last one you can do.is straighten the leg right here put the.toes down towards the floor.and this one you're probably going to.end up touching the floor that's fine.but just lower the toes down towards the.floor.and do a light tap and then from there.just.hike that hip up on the side holding for.about five seconds.relaxing and then doing five complete.repetitions when you do this always make.sure to switch over to the opposite side.to make sure all of the muscles are kept.in balance that will ensure.that we're trying to level it off the.best that we can so if you liked the.video and got a lot of relief please.show us your support by giving this.video a like and maybe subscribing to.our channel too if you have any comments.or

CEgMHaXGhmQ,How can I correct pelvic tilt using a yoga blocker and a stick? ,"(440, 614)",what im going to be doing is using a.yoga block if you dont have a yoga.block you can use a stack of books you.can also.just roll up a large bath towel im also.going to be using.my broomstick for stabilization but if.you dont have one.you can go right next to a wall instead.and you can also do this on a staircase.if you find that you find a spot that.this will accommodate you so im just.going to put.one leg up on or i should say one foot.up on the yoga block like this while the.other one just goes off.lets straighten both legs as much as.possible.and what im going to do from there is.whatever side that is not on that yoga.block.lets just slowly start to lower it down.towards the floor just like this when.you do this youre going to feel a lot.of muscle starting to be engaged.in the lower back across the hips the.pelvis into the legs.only go to your comfort level but just.keep going down as far as you feel.comfortable going when you get to a.point where its a very deep stretch.hold this for about five seconds and.then what youre going to do is slowly.start to then come back.up and do the opposite lets hike this.hip.up as much as we can its going to fire.those muscles just a little bit.differently.keep going up until you feel those.muscles.really fire hold this for five seconds.and then youre just going to simply.relax for a second and then repeat this.up to five times how we can engage the.muscles in a 360 degree.fashion is lets do this lets take the.leg.and straighten it the one thats off.that yoga block toes are going to be.pointed up towards the ceiling.from there what im going to do is im.just going to again slowly start to.lower that side down as much as we feel.comfortable.and then from there once we feel a very.good stretch hold this one for about.five seconds.youre just going to relax and then.youre just going to again.hike that hip up as much as you can five.second holds.relax do it five times you can also just.switch.this broomstick to the opposite side and.then do a.side pose also and this one can be very.very tricky so very go very comfortable.i should say only go to your comfort.level what im doing is im just.lowering that down as much as i can.and then from there im going to hike.that hip up as much as i can holding for.five seconds.and then doing five complete repetitions.and the last one you can do.is straighten the leg right here put the.toes down towards the floor.and this one youre probably going to.end up touching the floor thats fine.but just lower the toes down towards the.floor.and do a light tap and then from there.just.hike that hip up on the side holding for.about five seconds.relaxing and then doing five complete.repetitions when you do this always make.sure to switch over to the opposite side.to make sure all of the muscles are kept.in balance that will ensure,in this video i'm going to show you how.to self-fix a.short leg at home stay tuned.hey everyone dr rowe here at spike here.in st joseph michigan.so if you're dealing with a leg length.discrepancy especially if one side.feels shorter than the other then this.is a video that you're not going to want.to miss.i'm going to go over safe effective.stretches and exercises.that will help target a short leg and.the great part is you can do them in the.comfort of your own home.as a side note this is not going to help.correct an anatomical short leg this is.just for something where your hips.maybe your pelvis feels like it's hiked.up or just unlevel.so let's get started with them and.target that short leg and get it gone.right now so all of these exercises are.going to help activate the muscles.around the hips around the pelvis legs.and the low back that are commonly.associated with that short leg so give.all of them a try and make sure to go.with the ones that you feel.help you the most great part is we're.not going to be using any special.equipment either.the first one is called a 90 90 stretch.with a hip or pelvic tilt so what i'm.going to do.is lay flat on my back i'm going to go.next to a wall or a.door and put my legs at 90 degrees from.the knee so i should say the hip the.knees and the ankles should be at 90.degrees.plant your feet firmly against that door.of the wall what i'm going to do.is just simply tilt my pelvis.back so i'm kind of like tucking my.tailbone in and then i'm just going to.lift it up off the floor.you can kind of see how there's a nice.space in between there.i try to put my weight at the heels and.from there you should already start to.feel everything activate across the hips.and across the pelvis.what i want to do from here is i want to.hike.one side up so what i'm going to do is.i'm going to.tilt my right side like this up just a.little bit.and when you do this you're going to.notice that one knee.in this case whatever side you're.tilting up that side's knee is going to.be.slightly higher than the other so when.i'm looking at my knees right now.i can notice that right side a little.bit higher up.that means that you're in a good.position when i do this what i'm going.to do.is i'm going to then take my left side's.heel.and i'm going to drive downwards into.the door so i'm not pressing forward.into it i'm kind of.pressing down and when i do this i tend.to find that wearing shoes with grip.works a little bit better and when you.do this you're going to feel the.hamstring on that left side.really start to fire what i want to do.from there is i want to take my right.leg off and i'm just going to simply.march that right leg and stabilize with.the left.when you do this you're going to feel a.lot of muscle starting to fire.across the back the leg the hamstring.into the pelvis the glutes the buttocks.you name it.it's a good way to help build.coordination.and really strengthen those muscles that.are associated with that left leg.i try to do this 15 times very.very slowly and then from there what i'm.going to do is i'm just going to relax.take a bit of a breather and then from.there i'm just going to repeat this.three times on both sides it's going to.be important to do it on both.sides because at that point you're going.to keep everything balanced.across the lower back and hopefully.bring that short leg back up.into balance so a big cause of a pelvic.tilt that may.result in a short leg is due to glute or.buttock weakness.so what we need to do is strengthen them.to level that off and correct that short.leg and we can do that with a very.simple.exercise called a wall push let's go.next to a wall.and i'm going to space my body just.slightly away from the wall let's take.the arm closest to that wall place it.against it.to anchor us in so my shoulder my elbow.my arm.are firmly against that wall what i'm.going to do is whatever hip.is closest to the wall let's lift that.leg up till.it is nice and parallel with the floor.so the top of the leg should be parallel.with the floor.what i'm going to do from there is take.that knee and drive it.into the wall when you do this try to.press into it with your knee.and you're going to feel a very good uh.pretty much contraction.into the left side's glute so my right.knee is pressing in you're going to feel.it on the left side.the more that you press into it the more.it's going to activate that glute muscle.only go to your comfort level try to.hold this.for about 15 seconds you're just going.to relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five.times from there what i want to do is.then raise the knee up.even further so my knee is above my hip.and then i'm going to repeat this.process this is going to.activate that glute even more what you.want to do 15 second holds to your.comfort level.relax and then repeat up to.five times again it's important to then.switch to the opposite side.to keep everything in balance so this.next one is a great isometric.exercise that is going to help more or.less reset the pelvis.including the sacroiliac or si joints.i'm going to be using my.sturdy beat up broomstick right here if.you don't have a broomstick grab a stick.off a toilet plunger if you don't have.that.go out in the yard and grab a stick it.just needs to be long.and sturdy we're going to start off on a.flat surface you could do this in bed or.on the floor what i want to do is take.our stick and i'm going to place it in.between.my legs like this so one side of the.stick is going to be.above the knee while the other side is.going to be behind the knee.in this case it's behind my right knee.above my left.let's lift the legs up like this and.what i'm going to do.is whatever knee is away from you or i.should say behind the stick.we're going to drive that forward.towards us while the.knee that is closest to you or above the.stick is going to drive away so almost.like a.scissored stance when you do this you're.going to feel a very good.stretch into the lower back the pelvis.the glutes the buttock.only go to your comfort level you want.to hold this.to a comfortable point if it does feel.like it's causing discomfort please.discontinue.but do this for 15 seconds you're just.going to relax.and then you're going to repeat this up.to five.times and then from there you're just.going to simply.switch and do that on both sides to keep.everything in balance so the second part.of this and this is the part that.everybody likes because it usually.results in a.pop into the si joints is to take your.hands.put them together like this into a fist.lift your legs up like this.put them in between the knees and then.drive your knees.into actually i don't know if you heard.that on the microphone that popped.really well.into your hands that generally will get.those si.joints to pop crack or self-release.afterwards.just check everything especially those.short legs or the pelvic tilt and see if.it has improved it.so this is one of my personal favorite.ways to correct.pelvic tilt that might be causing a.short leg.what i'm going to be doing is using a.yoga block if you don't have a yoga.block you can use a stack of books you.can also.just roll up a large bath towel i'm also.going to be using.my broomstick for stabilization but if.you don't have one.you can go right next to a wall instead.and you can also do this on a staircase.if you find that you find a spot that.this will accommodate you so i'm just.going to put.one leg up on or i should say one foot.up on the yoga block like this while the.other one just goes off.let's straighten both legs as much as.possible.and what i'm going to do from there is.whatever side that is not on that yoga.block.let's just slowly start to lower it down.towards the floor just like this when.you do this you're going to feel a lot.of muscle starting to be engaged.in the lower back across the hips the.pelvis into the legs.only go to your comfort level but just.keep going down as far as you feel.comfortable going when you get to a.point where it's a very deep stretch.hold this for about five seconds and.then what you're going to do is slowly.start to then come back.up and do the opposite let's hike this.hip.up as much as we can it's going to fire.those muscles just a little bit.differently.keep going up until you feel those.muscles.really fire hold this for five seconds.and then you're just going to simply.relax for a second and then repeat this.up to five times how we can engage the.muscles in a 360 degree.fashion is let's do this let's take the.leg.and straighten it the one that's off.that yoga block toes are going to be.pointed up towards the ceiling.from there what i'm going to do is i'm.just going to again slowly start to.lower that side down as much as we feel.comfortable.and then from there once we feel a very.good stretch hold this one for about.five seconds.you're just going to relax and then.you're just going to again.hike that hip up as much as you can five.second holds.relax do it five times you can also just.switch.this broomstick to the opposite side and.then do a.side pose also and this one can be very.very tricky so very go very

doing five complete.repetitions when you do this always make.sure to switch over to the opposite side.to make sure all of the muscles are kept.in balance that will ensure.that we're trying to level it off the.best that we can so if you liked the.video and got a lot of relief please.show us your support by giving this.video a like and maybe subscribing to.our channel too if you have any comments.or

GUg4zMpchhk,How to identify if an exercise is mitigating pain?,"(165, 408)", You need to stop that. What were looking for is that your symptoms.are going to improve the farthest away. Right. Where youre feeling So like.if Im getting symptoms all the way down here into the hand.what I want to see is the hand gets better first. Yep. Now that could be numbness or tingling.or burning or whatever but you know.if you do the exercise you go.ah theres a little bit less burning there. Yep. Just a little bit I can feel it now. Right you really have to be uh aware.of it before you start your stretch.I always have patients put a number for intensity.on the pain and numbness in your hand and fingers right now.theyll say a six and well do some exercises.and sometimes they have to think about it. Yeah. Oh thats down to a three now.So or if its getting worse from a six to a eight.Well then were going to stop that exercise. Thats a good point Brad because people forget. Yeah. And it may even you know not happen the first day.They might do the exercise for a couple.of days and then they go yeah I cant remember.if its better or not but if they go it was a six.and now its only a three I mean so. A good thing is sometimes its like oh yeah.I forgot I even had it where it goes back to normal.Your mind kind of forgets where it was.Uh so writing it down on a calendar.or a piece of paper is a really good idea. This is a time yeah its really good to chart. Yeah. So as it gets better youre going to see the pain.hopefully get improve as you move up the arm.We actually have this tape so Brad.can show improvement here. Yep Yeah so Bob has these symptoms.and he starts to stretch his neck in a certain way.and this is what happens the next day.The pain the blue represents where the pain.or the symptoms numbness tingling are.Lets say it gets this much better all of a sudden.Oh this parts gone but it still hurts here.and maybe even a little worse up here.Thats actually a good sign cause its getting better.they call it distally or farther away from the neck. Yeah And you know the thing is.this could happen the same day even. Oh Ive had it happen in the treatment room. Yeah So it might be a couple of days.it might be the same day. Right. Either way you dont want it to get worse. Yeah We dont want it to come back.Lets say it gets better but then the next day it returns. Or the next day you do an exercise.and it causes pain down here. Yeah Thats a negative thing We dont want that. Right So yeah lets say youre you come in.and you see me and youre like this. Yep. And we start doing exercises.and all of a sudden you have pain down here too. Yeah. Thats the worst sign. Yeah then you gotta stop and change exercise.and thats what the therapist.thats our job is to get to the right exercise.Its just not a global thing.So lets say we do we get to the right exercise.and all of a sudden well oh the arm pain is gone. Yeah the numbness the tingling. But it hurts a little more up here possibly.But the arm pain the numbness tingling is all gone. Very good signs. You bet Were Im smiling as a therapist. Yeah now were happy. Yep. It doesnt take much to make us but this makes us happy. And thats nice A lot of people say.I thought it was a bad sign because of my neck hurts.but the arm is better and then you reassure them.oh this is good.People relax and things start improve even more yet.Uh do we want to continue. Sure lets continue. Yep you keep doing a lot of times the same stretch.sometimes it has to be modified.Uh and then the shoulder pain goes away.and we just have a little bit here.and Ill have patients while theyre doing the exercise.you know they can feel the pain dissipate. Go away. Yep uh and you know those are the easier ones.and out of all not everything is this easy unfortunately. Yeah. Its when it when it does happen its nice.Its kind of like the miracle in the clinic you know. Yeah its fun then The patients think youre God.laughs. And then we continue continue.and you know when it comes down to its just pain.in the neck here boy and everything else is feeling good.Thats a really good sign you continue to work it.and eventually. Boom its gone. Yeah Boom Wow," ob and Brad, the two most famous  physical therapists on the internet Hi folks I'm Bob Schrupp, Physical Therapist.Brad Heineck, Physical Therapist.Together, we are the most famous.physical therapists on the internet.In our opinion, of course.Today, we're going to talk about neck pain, pinched nerve,.how to know if you're doing the right.neck exercises or stretches.Sure.This is very important because if you're doing.the wrong one, it can make it worse.Absolutely, set you on the wrong direction quick.So, the common causes of a pinched nerve.in the neck are you could have a disc problem.Mm-hmm.You could have degeneration of the bones.to the point where they make the hole smaller.where the nerves come out.Sure.Um, you could have thoracic outlet syndrome,.and that's where you're getting pinching.between the collarbone and the first rib.Right.So, and you can also just have compression.from muscles in your neck, so.Right So there's more, but.There's more, yeah.We don't need to bore you.That's right So.(laughs).Neck pain can vary in, uh, in location, intensity,.depends on your diagnosis and your age and your posture.But the common locations are, and I got, we got them kinda.We mapped them out.We mapped them out This is for a pinched nerve,.but it's very common to have neck pain, of course,.up in the neck itself, um, but then you can also,.Brad, do you want to show them?.Sure So, we have, a lot of people may not.be aware of this, but oftentimes there's something called.referral pain, uh, their pain refers.down to the shoulder blade area.That's very common I can come over this way.onto the shoulder as the blue tape shows.Uh, and then if it's a nerve and it's pinched pretty bad,.it's very common that it's going to go down the arm.Now it may be in the front of the arm,.not always in the back like we have it here,.but down the arm and down all the way to the wrist,.and actually up into the fingers.Uh, and that's where our neck problems and carpal tunnel.can cross over symptoms.So, that's something we have to be careful of.And it can also be, say,.between the shoulder blades, too, Brad?.Yeah I don't have,.we don't have a piece of tape for that, but yeah,.it could radiate down into, or refer down, between as well.Sure.So those are the common areas, uh,.and if your pain is getting worse,.it's going to go further down.Right Right.It's pretty much a rule of thumb that can be relied on.Pretty universal.Yeah Um, so like, if you just have shoulder pain,.and it keeps referring down the arm,.that shoulder pain is getting worse.Right.If you have, uh, just regular neck pain,.not even a pinched nerve,.but the pain is going further down the arm.Mm-hmm.It's, it's getting worse, so.Yep Yeah, so if you're stretching your neck,.and maybe the neck feels better but the arm.starts to feel worse or it goes down the arm,.that's a big red flag.That's a bad sign, so.You need to stop that.What we're looking for is that your symptoms.are going to improve the farthest away.Right.Where you're feeling So like,.if I'm getting symptoms all the way down here into the hand.what I want to see is the hand gets better first.Yep.Now that could be numbness or tingling.or burning or whatever, but, you know.if you do the exercise, you go.ah, there's a little bit less burning there.Yep.Just a little bit, I can feel it now.Right, you really have to be, uh, aware.of it before you start your stretch.I always have patients put a number for intensity.on the pain and numbness in your hand and fingers right now,.they'll say a six and we'll do some exercises,.and sometimes they have to think about it.Yeah.Oh, that's down to a three now.So, or if it's getting worse from a six to a eight?.Well then, we're going to stop that exercise.That's a good point, Brad, because people forget.Yeah.And it may even, you know, not happen the first day.They might do the exercise for a couple.of days and then they go, yeah, I can't remember.if it's better or not, but if they go, it was a six.and now it's only a three, I mean, so.A good thing is sometimes it's like, oh yeah.I forgot I even had it, where it goes back to normal.Your mind kind of forgets where it was.Uh, so writing it down on a calendar.or a piece of paper is a really good idea.This is a time, yeah, it's really good to chart.Yeah.So as it gets better, you're going to see the pain.hopefully get, improve as you move up the arm.We actually have this tape so Brad.can show improvement here.Yep Yeah, so Bob has these symptoms.and he starts to stretch his neck in a certain way,.and this is what happens the next day.The pain, the blue represents where the pain.or the symptoms, numbness, tingling are.Let's say it gets this much better, all of a sudden.Oh, this part's gone but it still hurts here,.and maybe even a little worse up here.That's actually a good sign 'cause it's getting better.they call it distally or farther away from the neck.Yeah And, you know the thing is.this could happen the same day even.Oh, I've had it happen in the treatment room.Yeah So it might be a couple of days,.it might be the same day.Right.Either way, you don't want it to get worse.Yeah We don't want it to come back.Let's say it gets better, but then the next day it returns.Or the next day you do an exercise.and it causes pain down here.Yeah That's a negative thing We don't want that.Right So yeah let's say you're, you come in.and you see me and you're like this.Yep.And we start doing exercises,.and all of a sudden you have pain down here too.Yeah.That's the worst sign.Yeah, then you gotta stop and change exercise,.and that's what the therapist,.that's our job is to get to the right exercise.It's just not a global thing.So let's say we do, we get to the right exercise.and all of a sudden, well, oh, the arm pain is gone.Yeah, the numbness, the tingling.But it hurts a little more up here possibly.But the arm pain, the numbness, tingling is all gone.Very good signs.You bet We're, I'm smiling as a therapist.Yeah, now we're happy.Yep.It doesn't take much to make us, but this makes us happy.And that's nice A lot of people say.""I thought it was a bad sign because of my neck hurts,.but the arm is better,"" and then you reassure them,.oh, this is good.People relax and things start improve even more yet.Uh, do we want to continue?.Sure, let's continue.Yep, you keep doing, a lot of times the same stretch,.sometimes it has to be modified.Uh, and then the shoulder pain goes away.and we just have a little bit here,.and I'll have patients while they're doing the exercise,.you know, they can feel the pain dissipate.Go away.Yep, uh, and you know, those are the easier ones,.and out of all, not everything is this easy unfortunately.Yeah.It's when it, when it does happen, it's nice.It's kind of like the miracle in the clinic, you know.Yeah, it's fun then The patients think you're God.(laughs).And then we continue, continue,.and you know, when it comes down to it's just pain.in the neck here, boy, and everything else is feeling good.That's a really good sign, you continue to work it.and eventually.Boom, it's gone.Yeah Boom Wow.You're feeling much better, aren't you buddy?.I'm feeling great.You know, it's funny, you brought that story.about they think we're God or whatever, but.(laughs).you know, obviously we're not, but uh.(laughs).I did my first, one of my first rotations as a student.I got this patient and she's got better really well.Yeah.Better, and she, so my, my CI,.my instructor, clinical instructor,.said ""Oh, your disciple's here"".(laughs).She just would go on and on about how I made her better.Yeah, it was quite a boost as a student.(laughs).Yeah The other story I have is, real quick,.my mom had to go into a nursing home to get some treatment.I know this story.You know this story, and she goes,.""You guys are like Jesus,.you take care of the sick and you make people better"".Yeah That's going a little far.That's going a little far, so.Uh, this video by the way is a part of a series.of videos on neck pain.If you want to see the whole series,.hopefully we'll start.It's gotta be, they have to all be uploaded,.so it's gonna take a while.Right.But go to bobandbradcom, go to the program section.There's other programs there, by the way.Yes.And you'll see, find the one on neck pain.Watch the videos that you just want to watch.that pertain to you.Right, just go by the title.And check it out.Oh, the PDF printout is available for each video.shows a review of the video exercises,.a list of highlights we went through.There's nothing required for you, except for a smile.and good luck with it No e-mail or anything.We got, uh, fu-future videos that are going

reduce the neck hump just a quick one,in this video i'm going to demonstrate.some really simple but yet highly.effective exercises to get rid of your.daughter's hump or your neck hump once.and for all.so the neck hump or the dow use hump is.very often the result of a prolonged.poor posture.it's especially when we're looking at.our.phones or tablets or when we're sitting.and working at our desk and our.shoulders come forward and we sit.slouched we're placing a lot of pressure.on the base of our neck on this area.here and the pressure leads to strain.and the body wants to protect itself we.want to protect the area so what it does.is it lays down a few tissues a bit of.fat a bit of connective tissue in this.area to protect it and that's how you.get your dowage's hump so what we need.to do is we need to do some exercises i.can give you some exercises that will.really help to significantly reduce the.hump in your neck and the other thing we.need to do is we need to work on posture.trail to make sure we're nice and.upright you combine the two you've got.very powerful combination to get rid of.that hump once and for all so the.exercise i'm going to demonstrate to you.next is an absolute beauty in reducing.your neck hump and your diabetes hump.and why is that because it combines.mobilizing the area so straightway.reducing the hump with strengthening the.area which makes it easier for you to.maintain proper posture to ensure that.the hump doesn't come back so the.exercise is called the.aty mobilization exercise and you need.to lay face down for this so i've got a.mat here i've got a towel for under my.forehead so you lay face down and make.sure you chuck your chin in.and the first thing you do is your hand.palms facing down and we're raising our.arms up as high as we can i've got about.a 30 degree angle here away from my body.raise your arms up as high as you can.i'm now making a.as you can see i'm holding this i can.already feel the tension.in this area here and i'm holding this.for about 10 seconds.and i'm repeating this about five times.this is the a that i'm making yeah so do.this 10 seconds five times after that.you're moving to the t so now we're.spreading out the arms wide hand palm.still facing down.come high as high as you possibly can.and hold the scan for 10 seconds and.again i can really feel this.in this area there so hold this again.for 10 seconds repeat five times.yeah and once you've done that you go to.the y you see my arms are now both.up.and now raising arms up again hand palms.facing down.hold this again for 10 seconds.repeat five times.and that really mobilizes and.strengthens.the area.uh the lower part of your neck area now.it's it's quite an intense exercise if.you're struggling to hold each position.for 10 seconds repeat five times what.you do is you do the a first for 10.seconds then you move to the t then you.move to the y you hold each for about 10.seconds and you give yourself a rest and.you do a t y again a brilliant exercise.to reduce the neck hump just a quick one.if you enjoyed this first exercise.please don't hesitate and comment in the.box below give me a thumbs up or.subscribe to my channel okay let's move.on to the next exercise.so if you thought that the previous.exercise was a very intense exercise to.reduce your neck hump or your daughter's.hump wait until you've tried this one.with this exercise what we're trying to.do is flatten the hump not only by just.creating pressure and pull from top to.bottom but also by creating pool from.left to right so we're trying to flatten.the hump from all directions and all you.need for this is a chair and a book.the first thing you need to do is place.the book between your hands like such.then you need to place your elbows on.the top of the chair create a 90 degree.angle and your hips nitrile angle in.your knees.make sure your chin is tucked in.all the time.and all you do is now is you push your.upper body through your arms don't let.your head drop forward that will.actually induce the neck hump yeah so.keep it down your.your chin tucked in come all the way.down now you hold this brush you can.already feel the tension.on the on the hump and what you need to.know is you need to drop the book.drop the book and then keep your arms.keep your hands evenly spaced out and.what's going to happen because when.you're so tight in the area where your.neck hump is your arms will collapse in.so normally what happens.if you come down and you drop the book.and the arms will do this straight away.so now we're going to make this stretch.left and right by first of all holding.on to the book.coming all the way down and then you.drop the book.keep your arms as wide as you possibly.can hold this again for 10 seconds.and repeat.about five times again just once a day.an absolutely brilliant exercise to help.to reduce the dowager's hump or the neck.hump so this next exercise is a really.nice practical one you can do throughout.the day so i can imagine when you're in.office you can't always put your elbows.on the chair or lay face down somewhere.they might look at you a little bit.funnily so this is an exercise you can.do throughout the day when you're.working where you sit in front of your.computer and from time to time you do.this exercise so what you need to do is.grab your wrist and place the arms.behind you yeah sit upright grab your.wrist.really really try to get your arms.behind you as high up as you possibly.can sit upright and then what you do is.you tilt your head backwards.and you turn left.and right and you're definitely going to.feel and hear a bit of crunching when.you're doing this.if it doesn't hurt don't worry about it.it's good it loosens tissue off so.that's absolutely fine so really pull.your arms up as high as you possibly can.and turn your head to the left and the.right you do this for about 10 20 30.seconds but it's important that you try.to do this throughout the day and it.will help you and support the other.exercises you're doing in the evening.i'm probably not telling you anything.new if i say that these little gadgets.here play a big part in the creation of.the neck hump and the darwin's hump i'm.probably just average i spend an average.of two hours and 13 minutes per day.looking at my phone i just need to go.outside go to your local supermarket.just go outside and you see the majority.of people looking at their phones this.way with the head tilting forwards now.you can do all the exercises in the.world but if you keep on looking at your.phone with your head dropped down no way.you're going to get rid of that hump for.good so what we need to do is next to.the exercises you need to find a way to.look at your phone that places less.pressure on your neck and i've got the.right hack for you all you need to do.super simple all you need to do is.support the arm that holds your phone.with the other hand so look what i'm.doing now is i'm supporting my elbow of.the hand that holds my phone upright.suddenly my phone is upright suddenly.i'm not dropping my head forward i'm not.creating a lot of pressure on this area.where i have my neck hump phones upright.i can look at the phone this way i'll.create less pressure on the neck and all.the exercises that you do during the day.suddenly bear fruit because you're.taking away the irritation throughout.the day so what happens over time if you.have your daughter's hump or your neck.hump you've probably been walking like.this for quite some time and this kind.of position what it does is it.strengthens the muscles in the back of.your neck but it weakens the muscles.here in the front of your neck around.your throat and you need to strengthen.those muscles to be able to have a.proper posture be upright and create.less pressure on uh your the hump area.the base of your neck.so a very good exercise for this to do.are your chin tucks you've probably seen.them online but what i'm going to do is.i'm going to turbo charge you so i'm.going to give you turbocharged tin tucks.that will get your results quicker and.what you need for them is you need a.tara band you can also use a towel and.what we're going to do is we're going to.place the band around our head we're.going to do what we call isometric.exercises so with isometric exercises it.means you place your head in the right.position then you create a force a pull.but make sure that your head doesn't.leave that position so keep it in.position so you need to be upright chin.in nice and upright imagine there's like.a little threat on top here on your head.and you're pulling it forward so you've.got nice upright chin in shoulders.forward make sure you your attention.your tummy muscles as well your core.muscles as well and all you do now is.you pull with your arms pull the elastic.band keep it forward do not push your.chin forward keep your chin nicely.tucked in and you pull it you hold this.for about five to ten seconds i repeat.five to ten times now that's all you do.turbocharge i can already really feel it.to the front here make sure you know.your chin is nicely tucked in you hold.this for five to ten seconds and you.take it out again and do the same thing.here and you also need to do this for.the side.yeah so you come to the side to the left.up right here nice posture upright pull.to the side and then you can do this.with the towel as well doesn't really.make an awful lot of difference to the.side here hold this five ten seconds and.repeat about five to ten times and.obviously you need to do the other side.as well the only thing you shouldn't do.is the forward and then pull it forward.because the last thing you want to do is.you don't want to strengthen the back of.your neck because that's already strong.enough so turbocharged syntax will help.you to reduce the hump and keep your.juice as well because your posture is.actually getting better and you're.better aligned.i hope you've enjoyed this video i made.to how to reduce your neck hump i've.done another video on this subject as.well uh click here for the link to the.other video there might be some nuggets.in there for you that will help you to.reduce your neck hump even more if you.found value in this video please don't.hesitate and leave me a comment in the.box below i really appreciate that give.me a thumbs up.or subscribe to the channel if you.prefer to do that as well so for now.good luck with the exercises bye for now.take care of yourself take care of.someone else as well please if you can.and bye for now

fsdchGejKmU,How to do an advanced prayer exercise to reduce the neck hump?,"(212, 303)",so if you thought that the previous.exercise was a very intense exercise to.reduce your neck hump or your daughters.hump wait until youve tried this one.with this exercise what were trying to.do is flatten the hump not only by just.creating pressure and pull from top to.bottom but also by creating pool from.left to right so were trying to flatten.the hump from all directions and all you.need for this is a chair and a book.the first thing you need to do is place.the book between your hands like such.then you need to place your elbows on.the top of the chair create a 90 degree.angle and your hips nitrile angle in.your knees.make sure your chin is tucked in.all the time.and all you do is now is you push your.upper body through your arms dont let.your head drop forward that will.actually induce the neck hump yeah so.keep it down your.your chin tucked in come all the way.down now you hold this brush you can.already feel the tension.on the on the hump and what you need to.know is you need to drop the book.drop the book and then keep your arms.keep your hands evenly spaced out and.whats going to happen because when.youre so tight in the area where your.neck hump is your arms will collapse in.so normally what happens.if you come down and you drop the book.and the arms will do this straight away.so now were going to make this stretch.left and right by first of all holding.on to the book.coming all the way down and then you.drop the book.keep your arms as wide as you possibly.can hold this again for 10 seconds.and repeat.about five times again just once a day,in this video i'm going to demonstrate.some really simple but yet highly.effective exercises to get rid of your.daughter's hump or your neck hump once.and for all.so the neck hump or the dow use hump is.very often the result of a prolonged.poor posture.it's especially when we're looking at.our.phones or tablets or when we're sitting.and working at our desk and our.shoulders come forward and we sit.slouched we're placing a lot of pressure.on the base of our neck on this area.here and the pressure leads to strain.and the body wants to protect itself we.want to protect the area so what it does.is it lays down a few tissues a bit of.fat a bit of connective tissue in this.area to protect it and that's how you.get your dowage's hump so what we need.to do is we need to do some exercises i.can give you some exercises that will.really help to significantly reduce the.hump in your neck and the other thing we.need to do is we need to work on posture.trail to make sure we're nice and.upright you combine the two you've got.very powerful combination to get rid of.that hump once and for all so the.exercise i'm going to demonstrate to you.next is an absolute beauty in reducing.your neck hump and your diabetes hump.and why is that because it combines.mobilizing the area so straightway.reducing the hump with strengthening the.area which makes it easier for you to.maintain proper posture to ensure that.the hump doesn't come back so the.exercise is called the.aty mobilization exercise and you need.to lay face down for this so i've got a.mat here i've got a towel for under my.forehead so you lay face down and make.sure you chuck your chin in.and the first thing you do is your hand.palms facing down and we're raising our.arms up as high as we can i've got about.a 30 degree angle here away from my body.raise your arms up as high as you can.i'm now making a.as you can see i'm holding this i can.already feel the tension.in this area here and i'm holding this.for about 10 seconds.and i'm repeating this about five times.this is the a that i'm making yeah so do.this 10 seconds five times after that.you're moving to the t so now we're.spreading out the arms wide hand palm.still facing down.come high as high as you possibly can.and hold the scan for 10 seconds and.again i can really feel this.in this area there so hold this again.for 10 seconds repeat five times.yeah and once you've done that you go to.the y you see my arms are now both.up.and now raising arms up again hand palms.facing down.hold this again for 10 seconds.repeat five times.and that really mobilizes and.strengthens.the area.uh the lower part of your neck area now.it's it's quite an intense exercise if.you're struggling to hold each position.for 10 seconds repeat five times what.you do is you do the a first for 10.seconds then you move to the t then you.move to the y you hold each for about 10.seconds and you give yourself a rest and.you do a t y again a brilliant exercise.to reduce the neck hump just a quick one.if you enjoyed this first exercise.please don't hesitate and comment in the.box below give me a thumbs up or.subscribe to my channel okay let's move.on to the next exercise.so if you thought that the previous.exercise was a very intense exercise to.reduce your neck hump or your daughter's.hump wait until you've tried this one.with this exercise what we're trying to.do is flatten the hump not only by just.creating pressure and pull from top to.bottom but also by creating pool from.left to right so we're trying to flatten.the hump from all directions and all you.need for this is a chair and a book.the first thing you need to do is place.the book between your hands like such.then you need to place your elbows on.the top of the chair create a 90 degree.angle and your hips nitrile angle in.your knees.make sure your chin is tucked in.all the time.and all you do is now is you push your.upper body through your arms don't let.your head drop forward that will.actually induce the neck hump yeah so.keep it down your.your chin tucked in come all the way.down now you hold this brush you can.already feel the tension.on the on the hump and what you need to.know is you need to drop the book.drop the book and then keep your arms.keep your hands evenly spaced out and.what's going to happen because when.you're so tight in the area where your.neck hump is your arms will collapse in.so normally what happens.if you come down and you drop the book.and the arms will do this straight away.so now we're going to make this stretch.left and right by first of all holding.on to the book.coming all the way down and then you.drop the book.keep your arms as wide as you possibly.can hold this again for 10 seconds.and repeat.about five times again just once a day.an absolutely brilliant exercise to help.to reduce the dowager's hump or the neck.hump so this next exercise is a really.nice practical one you can do throughout.the day so i can imagine when you're in.office you can't always put your elbows.on the chair or lay face down somewhere.they might look at you a little bit.funnily so this is an exercise you can.do throughout the day when you're.working where you sit in front of your.computer and from time to time you do.this exercise so what you need to do is.grab your wrist and place the arms.behind you yeah sit upright grab your.wrist.really really try to get your arms.behind you as high up as you possibly.can sit upright and then what you do is.you tilt your head backwards.and you turn left.and right and you're definitely going to.feel and hear a bit of crunching when.you're doing this.if it doesn't hurt don't worry about it.it's good it loosens tissue off so.that's absolutely fine so really pull.your arms up as high as you possibly can.and turn your head to the left and the.right you do this for about 10 20 30.seconds but it's important that you try.to do this throughout the day and it.will help you and support the other.exercises you're doing in the evening.i'm probably not telling you anything.new if i say that these little gadgets.here play a big part in the creation of.the neck hump and the darwin's hump i'm.probably just average i spend an average.of two hours and 13 minutes per day.looking at my phone i just need to go.outside go to your local supermarket.just go outside and you see the majority.of people looking at their phones this.way with the head tilting forwards now.you can do all the exercises in the.world but if you keep on looking at your.phone with your head dropped down no way.you're going to get rid of that hump for.good so what we need to do is next to.the exercises you need to find a way to.look at your phone that places less.pressure on your neck and i've got the.right hack for you all you need to do.super simple all you need to do is.support the arm that holds your phone.with the other hand so look what i'm.doing now is i'm supporting my elbow of.the hand that holds my phone upright.suddenly my phone is upright suddenly.i'm not dropping my head forward i'm not.creating a lot of pressure on this area.where i have my neck hump phones upright.i can look at the phone this way i'll.create less pressure on the neck and all.the exercises that you do during the day.suddenly bear fruit because you're.taking away the irritation throughout.the day so what happens over time if you.have your daughter's hump or your neck.hump you've probably been walking like.this for quite some time and this kind.of position what it does is it.strengthens the muscles in the back of.your neck but it weakens the muscles.here in the front of your neck around.your throat and you need to strengthen.those muscles to be able to have a.proper posture be upright and create.less pressure on uh your the hump area.the base of your neck.so a very good exercise for this to do.are your chin tucks you've probably seen.them online but what i'm going to do is.i'm going to turbo charge you so i'm.going to give you turbocharged tin tucks.that will get your results quicker and.what you need for them is you need a.tara band you can also use a towel and.what we're going to do is we're going to.place the band around our head we're.going to do what we call isometric.exercises so with isometric exercises it.means you place your head in the right.position then you create a force a pull.but make sure that your head doesn't.leave that position so keep it in.position so you need to be upright chin.in nice and upright imagine there's like.a little threat on top here on your head.and you're pulling it forward so you've.got nice upright chin in shoulders.forward make sure you your attention.your tummy muscles as well your core.muscles as well and all you do now is.you pull with your arms pull the elastic.band keep it forward do not push your.chin forward keep your chin nicely.tucked in and you pull it you hold this.for about five to ten seconds i repeat.five to ten times now that's all you do.turbocharge i can already really feel it.to the front here make sure you know.your chin is nicely tucked in you hold.this for five to ten seconds and you.take it out again and do the same thing.here and you also need to do this for.the side.yeah so you come to the side to the left.up right here nice posture upright pull.to the side and then you can do this.with the towel as well doesn't really.make an awful lot of difference to the.side here hold this five ten seconds and.repeat about five to ten times and.obviously you need to do the other side.as well the only thing you shouldn't do.is the forward and then pull it forward.because the last thing you want to do is.you don't want to strengthen the back of.your neck because that's already strong.enough so turbocharged syntax will help.you to reduce the hump and keep your.juice as well because your posture is.actually getting better and you're.better aligned.i hope you've enjoyed this video i made.to how to reduce your neck hump i've.done another video on this subject as.well uh click here for the link to the.other video there might be some nuggets.in there for you that will help you to.reduce your neck hump even more if you.found value in this video please don't.hesitate and leave me a comment in the.box below i really appreciate that give.me a thumbs up.or subscribe to the channel if you.prefer to do that as well so for now.good luck with the exercises bye for now.take care of yourself take

fsdchGejKmU,How to do an advanced shoulder extension stretch exercise to reduce the neck hump?,"(331, 362)",this exercise so what you need to do is.grab your wrist and place the arms.behind you yeah sit upright grab your.wrist.really really try to get your arms.behind you as high up as you possibly.can sit upright and then what you do is.you tilt your head backwards.and you turn left.and right and youre definitely going to.feel and hear a bit of crunching when.youre doing this.if it doesnt hurt dont worry about it.its good it loosens tissue off so.thats absolutely fine so really pull.your arms up as high as you possibly can.and turn your head to the left and the.right you do this for about 10 20 30,in this video i'm going to demonstrate.some really simple but yet highly.effective exercises to get rid of your.daughter's hump or your neck hump once.and for all.so the neck hump or the dow use hump is.very often the result of a prolonged.poor posture.it's especially when we're looking at.our.phones or tablets or when we're sitting.and working at our desk and our.shoulders come forward and we sit.slouched we're placing a lot of pressure.on the base of our neck on this area.here and the pressure leads to strain.and the body wants to protect itself we.want to protect the area so what it does.is it lays down a few tissues a bit of.fat a bit of connective tissue in this.area to protect it and that's how you.get your dowage's hump so what we need.to do is we need to do some exercises i.can give you some exercises that will.really help to significantly reduce the.hump in your neck and the other thing we.need to do is we need to work on posture.trail to make sure we're nice and.upright you combine the two you've got.very powerful combination to get rid of.that hump once and for all so the.exercise i'm going to demonstrate to you.next is an absolute beauty in reducing.your neck hump and your diabetes hump.and why is that because it combines.mobilizing the area so straightway.reducing the hump with strengthening the.area which makes it easier for you to.maintain proper posture to ensure that.the hump doesn't come back so the.exercise is called the.aty mobilization exercise and you need.to lay face down for this so i've got a.mat here i've got a towel for under my.forehead so you lay face down and make.sure you chuck your chin in.and the first thing you do is your hand.palms facing down and we're raising our.arms up as high as we can i've got about.a 30 degree angle here away from my body.raise your arms up as high as you can.i'm now making a.as you can see i'm holding this i can.already feel the tension.in this area here and i'm holding this.for about 10 seconds.and i'm repeating this about five times.this is the a that i'm making yeah so do.this 10 seconds five times after that.you're moving to the t so now we're.spreading out the arms wide hand palm.still facing down.come high as high as you possibly can.and hold the scan for 10 seconds and.again i can really feel this.in this area there so hold this again.for 10 seconds repeat five times.yeah and once you've done that you go to.the y you see my arms are now both.up.and now raising arms up again hand palms.facing down.hold this again for 10 seconds.repeat five times.and that really mobilizes and.strengthens.the area.uh the lower part of your neck area now.it's it's quite an intense exercise if.you're struggling to hold each position.for 10 seconds repeat five times what.you do is you do the a first for 10.seconds then you move to the t then you.move to the y you hold each for about 10.seconds and you give yourself a rest and.you do a t y again a brilliant exercise.to reduce the neck hump just a quick one.if you enjoyed this first exercise.please don't hesitate and comment in the.box below give me a thumbs up or.subscribe to my channel okay let's move.on to the next exercise.so if you thought that the previous.exercise was a very intense exercise to.reduce your neck hump or your daughter's.hump wait until you've tried this one.with this exercise what we're trying to.do is flatten the hump not only by just.creating pressure and pull from top to.bottom but also by creating pool from.left to right so we're trying to flatten.the hump from all directions and all you.need for this is a chair and a book.the first thing you need to do is place.the book between your hands like such.then you need to place your elbows on.the top of the chair create a 90 degree.angle and your hips nitrile angle in.your knees.make sure your chin is tucked in.all the time.and all you do is now is you push your.upper body through your arms don't let.your head drop forward that will.actually induce the neck hump yeah so.keep it down your.your chin tucked in come all the way.down now you hold this brush you can.already feel the tension.on the on the hump and what you need to.know is you need to drop the book.drop the book and then keep your arms.keep your hands evenly spaced out and.what's going to happen because when.you're so tight in the area where your.neck hump is your arms will collapse in.so normally what happens.if you come down and you drop the book.and the arms will do this straight away.so now we're going to make this stretch.left and right by first of all holding.on to the book.coming all the way down and then you.drop the book.keep your arms as wide as you possibly.can hold this again for 10 seconds.and repeat.about five times again just once a day.an absolutely brilliant exercise to help.to reduce the dowager's hump or the neck.hump so this next exercise is a really.nice practical one you can do throughout.the day so i can imagine when you're in.office you can't always put your elbows.on the chair or lay face down somewhere.they might look at you a little bit.funnily so this is an exercise you can.do throughout the day when you're.working where you sit in front of your.computer and from time to time you do.this exercise so what you need to do is.grab your wrist and place the arms.behind you yeah sit upright grab your.wrist.really really try to get your arms.behind you as high up as you possibly.can sit upright and then what you do is.you tilt your head backwards.and you turn left.and right and you're definitely going to.feel and hear a bit of crunching when.you're doing this.if it doesn't hurt don't worry about it.it's good it loosens tissue off so.that's absolutely fine so really pull.your arms up as high as you possibly can.and turn your head to the left and the.right you do this for about 10 20 30.seconds but it's important that you try.to do this throughout the day and it.will help you and support the other.exercises you're doing in the evening.i'm probably not telling you anything.new if i say that these little gadgets.here play a big part in the creation of.the neck hump and the darwin's hump i'm.probably just average i spend an average.of two hours and 13 minutes per day.looking at my phone i just need to go.outside go to your local supermarket.just go outside and you see the majority.of people looking at their phones this.way with the head tilting forwards now.you can do all the exercises in the.world but if you keep on looking at your.phone with your head dropped down no way.you're going to get rid of that hump for.good so what we need to do is next to.the exercises you need to find a way to.look at your phone that places less.pressure on your neck and i've got the.right hack for you all you need to do.super simple all you need to do is.support the arm that holds your phone.with the other hand so look what i'm.doing now is i'm supporting my elbow of.the hand that holds my phone upright.suddenly my phone is upright suddenly.i'm not dropping my head forward i'm not.creating a lot of pressure on this area.where i have my neck hump phones upright.i can look at the phone this way i'll.create less pressure on the neck and all.the exercises that you do during the day.suddenly bear fruit because you're.taking away the irritation throughout.the day so what happens over time if you.have your daughter's hump or your neck.hump you've probably been walking like.this for quite some time and this kind.of position what it does is it.strengthens the muscles in the back of.your neck but it weakens the muscles.here in the front of your neck around.your throat and you need to strengthen.those muscles to be able to have a.proper posture be upright and create.less pressure on uh your the hump area.the base of your neck.so a very good exercise for this to do.are your chin tucks you've probably seen.them online but what i'm going to do is.i'm going to turbo charge you so i'm.going to give you turbocharged tin tucks.that will get your results quicker and.what you need for them is you need a.tara band you can also use a towel and.what we're going to do is we're going to.place the band around our head we're.going to do what we call isometric.exercises so with isometric exercises it.means you place your head in the right.position then you create a force a pull.but make sure that your head doesn't.leave that position so keep it in.position so you need to be upright chin.in nice and upright imagine there's like.a little threat on top here on your head.and you're pulling it forward so you've.got nice upright chin in shoulders.forward make sure you your attention.your tummy muscles as well your core.muscles as well and all you do now is.you pull with your arms pull the elastic.band keep it forward do not push your.chin forward keep your chin nicely.tucked in and you pull it you hold this.for about five to ten seconds i repeat.five to ten times now that's all you do.turbocharge i can already really feel it.to the front here make sure you know.your chin is nicely tucked in you hold.this for five to ten seconds and you.take it out again and do the same thing.here and you also need to do this for.the side.yeah so you come to the side to the left.up right here nice posture upright pull.to the side and then you can do this.with the towel as well doesn't really.make an awful lot of difference to the.side here hold this five ten seconds and.repeat about five to ten times and.obviously you need to do the other side.as well the only thing you shouldn't do.is the forward and then pull it forward.because the last thing you want to do is.you don't want to strengthen the back of.your neck because that's already strong.enough so turbocharged syntax will help.you to reduce the hump and keep your.juice as well because your posture is.actually getting better and you're.better aligned.i hope you've enjoyed this video i made.to how to reduce your neck hump i've.done another video on this subject as.well uh click here for the link to the.other video there might be some nuggets.in there for you that will help you to.reduce your neck hump even more if you.found value in this video please don't.hesitate and leave me a comment in the.box below i really appreciate that give.me a thumbs up.or subscribe to the channel if you.prefer to do that as well so for now.good luck with the exercises bye for now.take care of yourself take care of.someone else as well please if you can.and bye for now bye-bye.[Music],"{'(0.0, 5.58)': '[Music]', '(301.85, 310.66)': '[Music]', '(68.4,

fsdchGejKmU,How should you look at your cell phone that places less pressure on your neck?,"(412, 438)",pressure on your neck and ive got the.right hack for you all you need to do.super simple all you need to do is.support the arm that holds your phone.with the other hand so look what im.doing now is im supporting my elbow of.the hand that holds my phone upright.suddenly my phone is upright suddenly.im not dropping my head forward im not.creating a lot of pressure on this area.where i have my neck hump phones upright.i can look at the phone this way ill.create less pressure on the neck and all.the exercises that you do during the day,in this video i'm going to demonstrate.some really simple but yet highly.effective exercises to get rid of your.daughter's hump or your neck hump once.and for all.so the neck hump or the dow use hump is.very often the result of a prolonged.poor posture.it's especially when we're looking at.our.phones or tablets or when we're sitting.and working at our desk and our.shoulders come forward and we sit.slouched we're placing a lot of pressure.on the base of our neck on this area.here and the pressure leads to strain.and the body wants to protect itself we.want to protect the area so what it does.is it lays down a few tissues a bit of.fat a bit of connective tissue in this.area to protect it and that's how you.get your dowage's hump so what we need.to do is we need to do some exercises i.can give you some exercises that will.really help to significantly reduce the.hump in your neck and the other thing we.need to do is we need to work on posture.trail to make sure we're nice and.upright you combine the two you've got.very powerful combination to get rid of.that hump once and for all so the.exercise i'm going to demonstrate to you.next is an absolute beauty in reducing.your neck hump and your diabetes hump.and why is that because it combines.mobilizing the area so straightway.reducing the hump with strengthening the.area which makes it easier for you to.maintain proper posture to ensure that.the hump doesn't come back so the.exercise is called the.aty mobilization exercise and you need.to lay face down for this so i've got a.mat here i've got a towel for under my.forehead so you lay face down and make.sure you chuck your chin in.and the first thing you do is your hand.palms facing down and we're raising our.arms up as high as we can i've got about.a 30 degree angle here away from my body.raise your arms up as high as you can.i'm now making a.as you can see i'm holding this i can.already feel the tension.in this area here and i'm holding this.for about 10 seconds.and i'm repeating this about five times.this is the a that i'm making yeah so do.this 10 seconds five times after that.you're moving to the t so now we're.spreading out the arms wide hand palm.still facing down.come high as high as you possibly can.and hold the scan for 10 seconds and.again i can really feel this.in this area there so hold this again.for 10 seconds repeat five times.yeah and once you've done that you go to.the y you see my arms are now both.up.and now raising arms up again hand palms.facing down.hold this again for 10 seconds.repeat five times.and that really mobilizes and.strengthens.the area.uh the lower part of your neck area now.it's it's quite an intense exercise if.you're struggling to hold each position.for 10 seconds repeat five times what.you do is you do the a first for 10.seconds then you move to the t then you.move to the y you hold each for about 10.seconds and you give yourself a rest and.you do a t y again a brilliant exercise.to reduce the neck hump just a quick one.if you enjoyed this first exercise.please don't hesitate and comment in the.box below give me a thumbs up or.subscribe to my channel okay let's move.on to the next exercise.so if you thought that the previous.exercise was a very intense exercise to.reduce your neck hump or your daughter's.hump wait until you've tried this one.with this exercise what we're trying to.do is flatten the hump not only by just.creating pressure and pull from top to.bottom but also by creating pool from.left to right so we're trying to flatten.the hump from all directions and all you.need for this is a chair and a book.the first thing you need to do is place.the book between your hands like such.then you need to place your elbows on.the top of the chair create a 90 degree.angle and your hips nitrile angle in.your knees.make sure your chin is tucked in.all the time.and all you do is now is you push your.upper body through your arms don't let.your head drop forward that will.actually induce the neck hump yeah so.keep it down your.your chin tucked in come all the way.down now you hold this brush you can.already feel the tension.on the on the hump and what you need to.know is you need to drop the book.drop the book and then keep your arms.keep your hands evenly spaced out and.what's going to happen because when.you're so tight in the area where your.neck hump is your arms will collapse in.so normally what happens.if you come down and you drop the book.and the arms will do this straight away.so now we're going to make this stretch.left and right by first of all holding.on to the book.coming all the way down and then you.drop the book.keep your arms as wide as you possibly.can hold this again for 10 seconds.and repeat.about five times again just once a day.an absolutely brilliant exercise to help.to reduce the dowager's hump or the neck.hump so this next exercise is a really.nice practical one you can do throughout.the day so i can imagine when you're in.office you can't always put your elbows.on the chair or lay face down somewhere.they might look at you a little bit.funnily so this is an exercise you can.do throughout the day when you're.working where you sit in front of your.computer and from time to time you do.this exercise so what you need to do is.grab your wrist and place the arms.behind you yeah sit upright grab your.wrist.really really try to get your arms.behind you as high up as you possibly.can sit upright and then what you do is.you tilt your head backwards.and you turn left.and right and you're definitely going to.feel and hear a bit of crunching when.you're doing this.if it doesn't hurt don't worry about it.it's good it loosens tissue off so.that's absolutely fine so really pull.your arms up as high as you possibly can.and turn your head to the left and the.right you do this for about 10 20 30.seconds but it's important that you try.to do this throughout the day and it.will help you and support the other.exercises you're doing in the evening.i'm probably not telling you anything.new if i say that these little gadgets.here play a big part in the creation of.the neck hump and the darwin's hump i'm.probably just average i spend an average.of two hours and 13 minutes per day.looking at my phone i just need to go.outside go to your local supermarket.just go outside and you see the majority.of people looking at their phones this.way with the head tilting forwards now.you can do all the exercises in the.world but if you keep on looking at your.phone with your head dropped down no way.you're going to get rid of that hump for.good so what we need to do is next to.the exercises you need to find a way to.look at your phone that places less.pressure on your neck and i've got the.right hack for you all you need to do.super simple all you need to do is.support the arm that holds your phone.with the other hand so look what i'm.doing now is i'm supporting my elbow of.the hand that holds my phone upright.suddenly my phone is upright suddenly.i'm not dropping my head forward i'm not.creating a lot of pressure on this area.where i have my neck hump phones upright.i can look at the phone this way i'll.create less pressure on the neck and all.the exercises that you do during the day.suddenly bear fruit because you're.taking away the irritation throughout.the day so what happens over time if you.have your daughter's hump or your neck.hump you've probably been walking like.this for quite some time and this kind.of position what it does is it.strengthens the muscles in the back of.your neck but it weakens the muscles.here in the front of your neck around.your throat and you need to strengthen.those muscles to be able to have a.proper posture be upright and create.less pressure on uh your the hump area.the base of your neck.so a very good exercise for this to do.are your chin tucks you've probably seen.them online but what i'm going to do is.i'm going to turbo charge you so i'm.going to give you turbocharged tin tucks.that will get your results quicker and.what you need for them is you need a.tara band you can also use a towel and.what we're going to do is we're going to.place the band around our head we're.going to do what we call isometric.exercises so with isometric exercises it.means you place your head in the right.position then you create a force a pull.but make sure that your head doesn't.leave that position so keep it in.position so you need to be upright chin.in nice and upright imagine there's like.a little threat on top here on your head.and you're pulling it forward so you've.got nice upright chin in shoulders.forward make sure you your attention.your tummy muscles as well your core.muscles as well and all you do now is.you pull with your arms pull the elastic.band keep it forward do not push your.chin forward keep your chin nicely.tucked in and you pull it you hold this.for about five to ten seconds i repeat.five to ten times now that's all you do.turbocharge i can already really feel it.to the front here make sure you know.your chin is nicely tucked in you hold.this for five to ten seconds and you.take it out again and do the same thing.here and you also need to do this for.the side.yeah so you come to the side to the left.up right here nice posture upright pull.to the side and then you can do this.with the towel as well doesn't really.make an awful lot of difference to the.side here hold this five ten seconds and.repeat about five to ten times and.obviously you need to do the other side.as well the only thing you shouldn't do.is the forward and then pull it forward.because the last thing you want to do is.you don't want to strengthen the back of.your neck because that's already strong.enough so turbocharged syntax will help.you to reduce the hump and keep your.juice as well because your posture is.actually getting better and you're.better aligned.i hope you've enjoyed this video i made.to how to reduce your neck hump i've.done another video on this subject as.well uh click here for the link to the.other video there might be some nuggets.in there for you that will help you to.reduce your neck hump even more if you.found value in this video please don't.hesitate and leave me a comment in the.box below i really appreciate that give.me a thumbs up.or

fsdchGejKmU,How should you get proper posture by doing turbocharged chin tucks exercise?,"(484, 565)",that will get your results quicker and.what you need for them is you need a.tara band you can also use a towel and.what were going to do is were going to.place the band around our head were.going to do what we call isometric.exercises so with isometric exercises it.means you place your head in the right.position then you create a force a pull.but make sure that your head doesnt.leave that position so keep it in.position so you need to be upright chin.in nice and upright imagine theres like.a little threat on top here on your head.and youre pulling it forward so youve.got nice upright chin in shoulders.forward make sure you your attention.your tummy muscles as well your core.muscles as well and all you do now is.you pull with your arms pull the elastic.band keep it forward do not push your.chin forward keep your chin nicely.tucked in and you pull it you hold this.for about five to ten seconds i repeat.five to ten times now thats all you do.turbocharge i can already really feel it.to the front here make sure you know.your chin is nicely tucked in you hold.this for five to ten seconds and you.take it out again and do the same thing.here and you also need to do this for.the side.yeah so you come to the side to the left.up right here nice posture upright pull.to the side and then you can do this.with the towel as well doesnt really.make an awful lot of difference to the.side here hold this five ten seconds and.repeat about five to ten times and.obviously you need to do the other side.as well the only thing you shouldnt do.is the forward and then pull it forward.because the last thing you want to do is.you dont want to strengthen the back of,in this video i'm going to demonstrate.some really simple but yet highly.effective exercises to get rid of your.daughter's hump or your neck hump once.and for all.so the neck hump or the dow use hump is.very often the result of a prolonged.poor posture.it's especially when we're looking at.our.phones or tablets or when we're sitting.and working at our desk and our.shoulders come forward and we sit.slouched we're placing a lot of pressure.on the base of our neck on this area.here and the pressure leads to strain.and the body wants to protect itself we.want to protect the area so what it does.is it lays down a few tissues a bit of.fat a bit of connective tissue in this.area to protect it and that's how you.get your dowage's hump so what we need.to do is we need to do some exercises i.can give you some exercises that will.really help to significantly reduce the.hump in your neck and the other thing we.need to do is we need to work on posture.trail to make sure we're nice and.upright you combine the two you've got.very powerful combination to get rid of.that hump once and for all so the.exercise i'm going to demonstrate to you.next is an absolute beauty in reducing.your neck hump and your diabetes hump.and why is that because it combines.mobilizing the area so straightway.reducing the hump with strengthening the.area which makes it easier for you to.maintain proper posture to ensure that.the hump doesn't come back so the.exercise is called the.aty mobilization exercise and you need.to lay face down for this so i've got a.mat here i've got a towel for under my.forehead so you lay face down and make.sure you chuck your chin in.and the first thing you do is your hand.palms facing down and we're raising our.arms up as high as we can i've got about.a 30 degree angle here away from my body.raise your arms up as high as you can.i'm now making a.as you can see i'm holding this i can.already feel the tension.in this area here and i'm holding this.for about 10 seconds.and i'm repeating this about five times.this is the a that i'm making yeah so do.this 10 seconds five times after that.you're moving to the t so now we're.spreading out the arms wide hand palm.still facing down.come high as high as you possibly can.and hold the scan for 10 seconds and.again i can really feel this.in this area there so hold this again.for 10 seconds repeat five times.yeah and once you've done that you go to.the y you see my arms are now both.up.and now raising arms up again hand palms.facing down.hold this again for 10 seconds.repeat five times.and that really mobilizes and.strengthens.the area.uh the lower part of your neck area now.it's it's quite an intense exercise if.you're struggling to hold each position.for 10 seconds repeat five times what.you do is you do the a first for 10.seconds then you move to the t then you.move to the y you hold each for about 10.seconds and you give yourself a rest and.you do a t y again a brilliant exercise.to reduce the neck hump just a quick one.if you enjoyed this first exercise.please don't hesitate and comment in the.box below give me a thumbs up or.subscribe to my channel okay let's move.on to the next exercise.so if you thought that the previous.exercise was a very intense exercise to.reduce your neck hump or your daughter's.hump wait until you've tried this one.with this exercise what we're trying to.do is flatten the hump not only by just.creating pressure and pull from top to.bottom but also by creating pool from.left to right so we're trying to flatten.the hump from all directions and all you.need for this is a chair and a book.the first thing you need to do is place.the book between your hands like such.then you need to place your elbows on.the top of the chair create a 90 degree.angle and your hips nitrile angle in.your knees.make sure your chin is tucked in.all the time.and all you do is now is you push your.upper body through your arms don't let.your head drop forward that will.actually induce the neck hump yeah so.keep it down your.your chin tucked in come all the way.down now you hold this brush you can.already feel the tension.on the on the hump and what you need to.know is you need to drop the book.drop the book and then keep your arms.keep your hands evenly spaced out and.what's going to happen because when.you're so tight in the area where your.neck hump is your arms will collapse in.so normally what happens.if you come down and you drop the book.and the arms will do this straight away.so now we're going to make this stretch.left and right by first of all holding.on to the book.coming all the way down and then you.drop the book.keep your arms as wide as you possibly.can hold this again for 10 seconds.and repeat.about five times again just once a day.an absolutely brilliant exercise to help.to reduce the dowager's hump or the neck.hump so this next exercise is a really.nice practical one you can do throughout.the day so i can imagine when you're in.office you can't always put your elbows.on the chair or lay face down somewhere.they might look at you a little bit.funnily so this is an exercise you can.do throughout the day when you're.working where you sit in front of your.computer and from time to time you do.this exercise so what you need to do is.grab your wrist and place the arms.behind you yeah sit upright grab your.wrist.really really try to get your arms.behind you as high up as you possibly.can sit upright and then what you do is.you tilt your head backwards.and you turn left.and right and you're definitely going to.feel and hear a bit of crunching when.you're doing this.if it doesn't hurt don't worry about it.it's good it loosens tissue off so.that's absolutely fine so really pull.your arms up as high as you possibly can.and turn your head to the left and the.right you do this for about 10 20 30.seconds but it's important that you try.to do this throughout the day and it.will help you and support the other.exercises you're doing in the evening.i'm probably not telling you anything.new if i say that these little gadgets.here play a big part in the creation of.the neck hump and the darwin's hump i'm.probably just average i spend an average.of two hours and 13 minutes per day.looking at my phone i just need to go.outside go to your local supermarket.just go outside and you see the majority.of people looking at their phones this.way with the head tilting forwards now.you can do all the exercises in the.world but if you keep on looking at your.phone with your head dropped down no way.you're going to get rid of that hump for.good so what we need to do is next to.the exercises you need to find a way to.look at your phone that places less.pressure on your neck and i've got the.right hack for you all you need to do.super simple all you need to do is.support the arm that holds your phone.with the other hand so look what i'm.doing now is i'm supporting my elbow of.the hand that holds my phone upright.suddenly my phone is upright suddenly.i'm not dropping my head forward i'm not.creating a lot of pressure on this area.where i have my neck hump phones upright.i can look at the phone this way i'll.create less pressure on the neck and all.the exercises that you do during the day.suddenly bear fruit because you're.taking away the irritation throughout.the day so what happens over time if you.have your daughter's hump or your neck.hump you've probably been walking like.this for quite some time and this kind.of position what it does is it.strengthens the muscles in the back of.your neck but it weakens the muscles.here in the front of your neck around.your throat and you need to strengthen.those muscles to be able to have a.proper posture be upright and create.less pressure on uh your the hump area.the base of your neck.so a very good exercise for this to do.are your chin tucks you've probably seen.them online but what i'm going to do is.i'm going to turbo charge you so i'm.going to give you turbocharged tin tucks.that will get your results quicker and.what you need for them is you need a.tara band you can also use a towel and.what we're going to do is we're going to.place the band around our head we're.going to do what we call isometric.exercises so with isometric exercises it.means you place your head in the right.position then you create a force a pull.but make sure that your head doesn't.leave that position so keep it in.position so you need to be upright chin.in nice and upright imagine there's like.a little threat on top here on your head.and you're pulling it forward so you've.got nice upright chin in shoulders.forward make sure you your attention.your tummy muscles as well your core.muscles as well and all you do now is.you pull with your arms pull the elastic.band keep it forward do not push your.chin forward keep your chin nicely.tucked in and you pull it you hold this.for about five to ten seconds i repeat.five to ten times now that's all you do.turbocharge i can already really feel it.to the front here make sure you know.your chin is nicely tucked in you hold.this for five to ten seconds and you.take it out again and do the same thing.here and you also need to do this for.the side.yeah so you come to the side to the left.up right here nice posture upright pull.to the side and then you can do this.with the towel as well doesn't really.make an awful lot of difference to the.side here hold this five ten seconds and.repeat about five to ten times and.obviously you need to do the other side.as well the only thing you shouldn't do.is the forward and then pull it forward.because the last thing you want to do is.you don't want to strengthen the back of.your neck because that's already strong.enough so turbocharged syntax will help.you to reduce the hump and keep your.juice as well because your posture is.actually getting better and you're.better aligned.i hope you've enjoyed this video i made.to how to reduce your neck hump i've.done another video on this subject as.well uh click here for the link to the.other video there might be some nuggets.in there for you that will help you to.reduce your neck hump even more if you.found value in this video please don't.hesitate and leave me a comment in the.box below i really appreciate that give.me a thumbs up.or subscribe to the channel if you.prefer to do that as well so for now.good luck with the exercises bye for now.take care of yourself take care of.someone else as well please if you can.and bye for now bye-bye.[Music],"{'(0.0, 5.58)': '[Music]', '(301.85, 310.66)': '[Music]',

to do a little 90 90 today,.which is going to, you're going to love this.Go ahead and just bring your hand over your hand over here,.and just stretch the side from this cross-legged position.Let's just do a few of these.Just warm it on a feeling good.It's a happy day.Let's get those hips moving.Here we go.Work it You're stretching your obliques right here.A little bit of the gluteus minimus.We have a maximus, we have a medius, and we have a minimus.Let's give it a little attention here.All right.So the 90 90 means that your front knee.is going to be at 90 degrees and your back is also,.so let's go ahead and bring,.you can do the mirror image of what I do.So I'm bringing my left foot forward.You bring your right foot forward,.just like this.So we see a 90 degrees here.We see a 90 degrees here and we're straight up.So we're going to start with a stretch.We're going to lean back here.and you're going to feel stretched in that joint capsule.Okay?.Ooh That is a good stretch.What we're going to do three different stretches.and then we'll do the exercises.We're pulsing into that end range motion.Just lean back Feel that,.bring that leg back a little bit further, if you can.Just, so it comes straight off from your body and then.into a 90 degrees Good.Now come up and just lean over to your left.Grab that outer knee.And the hand comes on the head and just coming over to the.side Ooh, fueling that inner thigh, loving it,.doing things that your hips probably.haven't done in a while.You're going to get up from this feeling pretty fantastic.Go ahead all the way over to the side, pulling it,.pulling it, pulling it.And now we're going to the next one.We're going to dive in forward Okay?.I want your knee I want your,.your nose going right towards the middle of your shin.Not over to the left or to the right, right in the middle.And now we feel it in the glutes.We feel it down the leg a little bit.Maybe even in that upper outer group.called the gluteus medius.Feeling good.If you can put your hands out,.come a little bit more forward,.take some deep breaths in all the way through your nose.and let your body relax all the way.Good coming back Now we're going to take the back leg.Keep the knee down at all possible.If at all possible and just lift the leg, just like this.We're going to lift it and bring it down Lift it.If this is impossible for you,.come over here and cheat a little bit,.keep lifting and down lift just like that Lift down.Drive that into the ground That back leg is lifting up.Okay so, now what we're going to do.is we're going to come to the top of that range of motion.And we're going to pulse,.pulse it, pulse it, pulse it.Ooh Are you feeling a burn?.I hope so Let's get right into it.Pulse it, pulse it, pulse it.Good Let's go.10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.Okay, next one.You're going to keep this knee down.If you have to lean over here and we're going to lift that,.just like that.We're going to lift the foot while the knee stays down.A lot of you are going to be able to just be totally.straight up I can't.You got to push the opposite knee in.and just lift that foot.If you have to push on that knee and lift the foot off,.keep lifting.We love it.Keep lifting and lift lift.Ooh, that's good.You feel way deep in if you're just visualizing it right.now, it really, Hey, this isn't really happening.Really, go over here and lift it that way.Just get it done However you got to get it done.Okay We're going to go back to the back leg again.Okay Lift and down Lift and down.Good Lift and down Lift and down.Now let's go What we're going to do is keep lifting.Now we're going to come up to the very peak of the range of.motion and then just kind of hang out there and pulse.So pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse,.drive that knee into the ground.Lift that foot Ooh.If you don't feel it, burn, put some leg weights on,.but I don't think you're alive.Okay.Let's go ahead and do the front one again and lift and down.lift, good, lift and down, lift.And if you have to just lift it like this, if you have to,.but we want this active for the most part, lifting it,.lifting it.Good.So we're going to switch to the other side,.go ahead and put the other leg forward.My right, your left and bring it on back.The chest is up and we're going to just notice the back leg.is at 90 degrees front legs at 90 degrees.And we're just going to come back and do a nice stretch.Chest is up Keep those abs engaged.If you can just remind them in,.not just allowing that belly to come out, leaning back,.feeding that cartilage, some lubrication,.pushing out any waste products, bringing in nutrition.Okay, we're going to go ahead and come to the side now.So come straight up.Grab that outer knee and pull to the side If,.if you can't bring this hand up, that's okay right now.And just come to the side Again, you might just be here.No problem Remind that belly button in smile a little bit.Relax that face We want your body to know, Hey,.I can do this.I do a lot of cold water plunges, right?.To go into where there's snow and cold water.And my body knows now that I'm not going to get out.So it doesn't give me the resistance Right?.Let your body know that you're that you're in on this.You're ready You're going forward with this.No matter what to keep that relaxed countenance and allow.your body to go into a little bit of a painful stretch,.but relax your body says, okay, okay,.they're going to do this We're okay.We're in Now come forward.Bring the nose in between, the ankle and the knee.You coming right in.Ooh, I love this one.This is all in preparation So you can do that.Great 90, 90, the lift That's a good one.I just can't wait for you to stand up after this.leave a comment, please.Good.Come up.And then we're going to lift that back leg You ready?.Lift and down.Lift and down, lift Perfect Lift.I've seen people lift their legs over a foam roller I mean,.they have that kind of range of motion I'm not there,.but I'm participating.And so are you.Now let's get a little pulse in there So pulse it pulse it.That muscle can reset fire again.Pulse it, pulse it driving that knee into the ground.10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.Good Let's go with the front now.we're going to lift that foot and bring it down.Lift it, bring it down, lift.Bring it down again.If you need to cheat a little bit Come over here.Not a problem.Eventually you're going to get your body way more straight.up and down Lift it up and down Lift.Drive that knee into the ground.Even drive the opposite knee into the ground.Drive your right knee into the ground.as you're lifting your left leg.Good.Not the whole leg though Good and pulse.Pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse.Just give your body what it needs Come on, push it,.make it burn.Good All right, let's get the back one again.Lift and down Lift, down Good.I seem to be doing the back a lot easier than I can do the.front Probably the same for you.Keep lifting Feeling it Bodies, warming up,.temperature, warming up,.Working things you normally do not work.I find after I get up from this, I'm aligned.My toes are pointing straight Everything.I don't have that little foot flare or anything like that.I feel stable.Good Now pulse it.Pulse pulse.Keep pulsing.Come on, give it.10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.Ooh Beautiful.Let's go with the front again You ready?.Go, pulse, hit it, bringing it up, bringing it up.It should be burning right now.And now give it 10 pulses go.One, two, three, four, five, six, seven on the home stretch.Eight, nine, 10 So good.Okay We're gonna do a little froggy pose here.So come on all fours.Let's bring the legs real wide again 90 degrees real wide,.and then get those elbows on the ground and then just push.back Good You're gonna feel,.A nice stretch to just finish this off.And just breathe into a big breath in as you breathe out,.just push with your hands a little bit.You feel that deep into the joint capsule, big breath in,.Good just breathe out Into the joint capsule.Good Let's slowly come out of this.Go back into that cross-legged position.And let's leave off where we started.Let's just do a few of these just laterally bend.Then bring the handover.Good.You might want to pair this with my hip stretch videos of.some of the low back and core videos.So happy that you're taking care of your hips.And it was great to be with you here today","{'(293.4, 294.233)': 'Good', '(625.839, 628.48)': 'just like this', '(0.39, 1.71)':

foreigners is.mainly in the rear shoulder and.sometimes in the back of your wrist and.have your arm up and reach in with your.other thumb into the back of your.shoulder blade the subscript large is.located attached to your shoulder blade.inside your armpit when you located the.muscle you might be slightly tender and.just press gently into it as you can see.by my face it can be quite painful when.you find the tender spot this is called.a trigger point you can hold this.position until it releases for 20 to 30.seconds and then move on to the next one.then return to the tender spot six to.eight times to ensure the muscle.actually releases subscapularis.myofascial release this is a much more,welcome back to active chiropractor guys.and today I'm going to show you how to.do massage for your subscapularis muscle.a subsample hours muscle is one of the.rotator cuff muscle is attached to your.shoulder blade which is your scapula and.into your humerus so it does a lot of.internal rotation so you can imagine in.a lot of sports you do a lot is motion.it can cause a lot of issues spasm and.get weak so if you can massage all those.trigger points out will definitely help.you with a mobility and pain relief as.well especially if you had some sort of.injury location or post surgery this.massage would definitely free it up and.help you recover static sub scab the.subscapular is pain with foreigners is.mainly in the rear shoulder and.sometimes in the back of your wrist and.have your arm up and reach in with your.other thumb into the back of your.shoulder blade the subscript large is.located attached to your shoulder blade.inside your armpit when you located the.muscle you might be slightly tender and.just press gently into it as you can see.by my face it can be quite painful when.you find the tender spot this is called.a trigger point you can hold this.position until it releases for 20 to 30.seconds and then move on to the next one.then return to the tender spot six to.eight times to ensure the muscle.actually releases subscapularis.myofascial release this is a much more.intense technique it really digs into.the muscle so you can release it this is.a type of myofascial release like the.technique before just place your thumb.where the trigger point is but now.slowly external and internally rotate.your arm this is the action of the.subscapular muscle by doing this it.works on the subscapular muscle spindles.do the rotation eight to ten times nice.and slow then move on to the next tender.spot on subscapularis massage with a.broomstick you can use any type of stick.as long as it hits the subscapular.muscle try not to use anything too thin.because it can get pointing and will.hurt just like the static thumb massage.early in the video just lean slightly.forward and then place the broomstick.into your subscapular muscle which is at.the back of the armpit against the.inside of your shoulder blade of course.this is going to be a lot more intense.than using your thumb as you can add.weight into it by leaning forward into.the tight spots.hold the position for twenty to thirty.seconds then move on to the next.position then go back to the position.six to eight times once again you can.use more a facial technique by adding.internal and external.rotation of your arm this causes.contraction and elongation of the.subscapular muscle therefore working on.the muscle spindles of the subscapularis.muscle do about eight to ten rotation.before moving to the next spot because.if you do have shoulder issues check out.my fixed my rounded shoulder video or.even mobilize your shoulders with a.power bed now remember support my.channel hit like hip subscribe comment.below tell me what you liked about this.video even suggest to me what

#NAME?,How to effectively treat AC joint pain?,"(113, 197)",And Im gonna find I know where it is on me. Mhm. And so here again I got my finger right on it now.And now Im gonna put the other one on top.And now Im gonna rub.And its sore.Was yours sore. No Mine arent. Oh this one is sore.And I do have a little trouble with this.Especially if I do too many pushups.or if I work the chest muscle too much.So Im gonna rub for.And actually its feeling better already. Good. When you start rubbing.if it starts getting worse and worse and worse.That means it might be too tender to do that.And you might have to ice it for a couple days. Sure Yep. First. But if not if you do start doing this.and it actually starts to decrease a little bit.or even feels numb thats a good sign. Right and thatll usually happen within 30 seconds. 30 seconds to a minute yeah.I mean you can tell pretty quickly.Now you can keep doing this for a couple minutes.Maybe even up to five if you want.but your fingers are gonna probably fatigue.before you get that far. Yep. And you can do it every day or every other day.They arent real clear on some of this stuff as how. Right. often you wanna do it.You wanna make sure you dont do it to the point where.the skin breaks down. Right. Cause Ive seen that before.But if you could do it you know its a nice one to do.cause you could do it just about anywhere.as long as people dont stare at ya.brad laughs.But this is a actually this feels.a lot better on me already.This actually its kind of stunning sometimes.how well this works. Right. So this is what Ive tried.Now if youve separated your shoulder.and you know its sticking up a little bit,"Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.And together, we have the most famous.physical therapists on the internet.In our opinion, of course, Bob.All right, this is Napoleon;.bone-a-part.Right.And today we're gonna show you the single best treatment.you can do for AC joint pain or, acromioclavicular pain.So what are we talking about here? Let's get specific.Now, that's a lot of words, isn't it though?.Yeah.The clavicle, is the collarbone.Okay?.So that's this right here.I'm actually gonna lean him forward like this.Yep.How's that Brad?.Yeah, how does that look, Nick?.Lonnie?.Lonnie?.Okay We got the collarbone,.and it attaches to another bone right here,.which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there.Now the acromion is nothing more than,.part of the shoulder blade-.Right.Of the scapula.But this is the pain, and we had a video,.I'll probably put it up right here, on how to test whether.or not you are having acromioyou know, AC joint pain.Yeah.If it's positive, you know, one of the simple tests.is just to bring the arm across like this.Yep.And it hurts.Up in that thing.A lot of people who are having trouble with pushups,.or bench press-.Mhm.may feel this.So this is the simple treatment you're gonna do.There's others, and we'll talk about those.But right now, the first treatment you wanna try,.is you're gonna take your hand.And you're gonna follow along your own collarbone.Let's say it's the left side.You're gonna get to that joint.And you're gonna put one finger over top the other.And you're gonna rub, 'cause there's a ligament there.And you're gonna rub this way.Here, lemme do it from this side.Okay.I think your arm was in the way, Bob.So here we get to the joint.That finger there, the other finger on top.So that you can get a lot of pressure down.And you're gonna work it this way.Okay?.And, it's gonnayou're gonna find out.that it's hard to feel where that joint is a lot of times.Yes.But you'll know because it's gonna be the tender spot.It's usually the tender spot.And you know, so if I'm doing it on myself,.I'm gonna follow along on the collarbone.And I'm gonna find, I know where it is on me.Mhm.And so here again, I got my finger right on it now.And now I'm gonna put the other one on top.And now I'm gonna rub.And it's sore.Was yours sore?.No Mine aren't.Oh, this one is sore.And I do have a little trouble with this.Especially if I do too many pushups,.or, if I work the chest muscle too much.So, I'm gonna rub for.And actually it's feeling better already.Good.When you start rubbing,.if it starts getting worse, and worse, and worse.That means it might be too tender to do that.And you might have to ice it for a couple days-.Sure Yep.First.But if not, if you do start doing this.and it actually starts to, decrease a little bit,.or even feels numb, that's a good sign.Right, and that'll usually happen within 30 seconds.30 seconds to a minute, yeah.I mean you can tell pretty quickly.Now, you can keep doing this for a couple minutes.Maybe even up to five if you want,.but your fingers are gonna probably fatigue,.before you get that far.Yep.And, you can do it every day, or every other day.They aren't real clear on some of this stuff as how-.Right.often you wanna do it.You wanna make sure you don't do it to the point where.the skin breaks down.Right.'Cause I've seen that before.But if you could do it, you know, it's a nice one to do,.'cause you could do it just about anywhere.as long as people don't stare at ya.(brad laughs).But this is a actually, this feels.a lot better on me already.This actually, it's kind of stunning sometimes.how well this works.Right.So, this is what I've tried.Now, if you've separated your shoulder,.and you know, it's sticking up a little bit.You might have to receive immob, immobilization.Or a manipulation from a chiropractor,.or from a physical therapist.Right.So, and we were talking about that.We just felt it was beyond the scope.of what you could try on your own.Right.So, we're gonnaunfortunately, you're gonna.have to see someone for that.But I would try this first, and see how it goes.You bet It's just another fine idea.that we're gonna continue to give you.So subscribe to us.Just keep clicking that subscribe button.Well-.Yeah.they don't let you do that, do they?.No, you can only do it once.I click

4h3V6F4Rl_k,How to self-diagnose shoulder pain as radiculopathy with the foraminal compression test?,"(57, 105)",causing the shoulder pain and were.going to go from top to bottom.so the first structured actually caused.you a shoulder pain is your neck.shoulder pain can arise from your neck.especially if youre suffering from a.radiculopathy which is essentially a.nerve which being pinched in the neck.and you know when you have a red.radiculopathy because you have this.shooting pain from your from your neck.into your shoulder into your elbow into.your arm sort of even to your fingers.and and the tests you can do is what we.call the foramen or compression test and.what you need to do so say my right.shoulder is the effect that is the.affected side is you need to turn your.head to the right and until you had.backwards and if that reproduces your.shoulder pain this can also give you a.pain between your shoulder blades if.that reproduces it then most likely you.show the plain stems from from your neck.so something needs to be done your your,I we see a lot of patients in the clinic.complaining of shoulder pains and it's.not surprising actually because it's.estimated that 70% of people will will.suffer from shoulder pain at one stage.in their lives and another statistic.that's come out is that once you have.the shoulder pain almost 50% of patients.will still have it 12 months after the.onset of the pain so it's something that.persists for a long long time once you.have it hi my name is Jasper and I'm a.chiropractor at Milton a forum.chiropractic clinics were located on the.outskirts of Rosen admins and and.Cambridge and today I'd like to show you.Hugh tests so you can find out if you.have a shoulder problem what's actually.causing the shoulder problem because we.need to know what's causing it first.before we can do any give you any help.before you can give yourself any help.with it so I'm going to give you a few.tests to find out which structure is.causing the shoulder pain and we're.going to go from top to bottom.so the first structured actually caused.you a shoulder pain is your neck.shoulder pain can arise from your neck.especially if you're suffering from a.radiculopathy which is essentially a.nerve which being pinched in the neck.and you know when you have a red.radiculopathy because you have this.shooting pain from your from your neck.into your shoulder into your elbow into.your arm sort of even to your fingers.and and the tests you can do is what we.call the foramen or compression test and.what you need to do so say my right.shoulder is the effect that is the.affected side is you need to turn your.head to the right and until you had.backwards and if that reproduces your.shoulder pain this can also give you a.pain between your shoulder blades if.that reproduces it then most likely you.show the plain stems from from your neck.so something needs to be done your your.neck the second structure that can cause.a shoulder pain is a structure that we.call the brachial plexus and that's a.structure anatomical structure consists.of nerves and blood vessels and it runs.essentially from your neck into your.shoulder and it can be get compressed.here it can be compressed by by a muscle.or can be compressed by the clavicle or.be compressed by you by the first.breakeven and the test we need to do to.determine if the brachial plexus is the.cause of your shoulder pain is what we.call the ruse test now with the boost s.what you need to do is stick your arms.up like this 90 degree in the shoulder.90 degree in the elbows then pull your.arms back a little bit so you pull your.arms a little bit and then what you do.for three minutes if you open and shut.your hands now this test is positive if.you have a heaviness or weakness in the.arms or if you get numbness and tingling.in your hands now you will get overly.tired when you do this you're looking.for four really heaviness and and the.weakness in the arms for three minutes.if that's positive then your shoulder.pain might be caused by a compression of.the brachial plexus the third structure.can cause be sure the problem is a tear.in one of the rotator cuff muscles so.the rotator cuff muscles a muscle that.surround the joint and keep the joint.into place and I'll Shiva give you the.two most common ones the Communists the.Communists tear of a Muslim and rotator.cuff is in a muscle called the.supraspinatus and what we do for this.one is the auntie can test so what you.do with this is you straighten out your.arm you point your thumb towards the.ground so you got like a thirty degree.angle front here and then but the other.hand you apply a little bit of pressure.and you resist it and if this is so then.most likely you've got a tear in one of.the rotator cuff muscles called the.supraspinatus the other tests we can do.for another muscle part of the rotator.cuff is the infraspinatus and what you.do the tester you do to test if you have.a tear in this muscle is you put your.elbow into your side you turn your arm.out a little bit you hold it here and.with the other hand you pull and you see.if this inflicts you a pain in your.shoulder if it does it's an.infraspinatus tear in the cause in your.your shoulder problem another structure.what might cause you an issue is the.see joint and the AC joint is located on.top of your shoulder so you go if you.come up from your free upper arm you.feel like a heart structure a bony bit.and you go in about half an inch and you.feel a little bit of over over dip and.that's the AC joint that's commonly.affected with people who push weights i.weight lifters and stuff especially.would show the process up and down and.also we see a lot of traumatic events.for example with cyclists when they land.when they fall of the bike and a land on.the shoulder you often see here but.almost like a stepped effect like your.shoulder is a bit lower than your.clavicle.that's the AC joint here so the tests.you can do to determine if your pain is.actually caused by the AC joint is to.put a par test and what you do is you.interlock your fingers and you literally.just pull apart as hard as you can.now and if you get a little bit of an.ache top of your shoulder it's probably.an AC joint something can be done about.it we can help you with it but that's.where your your problem comes from the.AC joint.it could also also be a bit of.osteoarthritis you need to be overly a.bit older for that maybe having had a.trauma in the past in your shoulder a.lot of grinding goes on I'm not talking.about the occasional clicking when you.move your arm but it's the grinding.stuff that is a bit of a telltale sign.as well for osteoarthritis and you can.have an opinion an opinion is actually.one of the tendons within the shoulder.joint in the area which getting pinched.so when your your your shoulder.decreases it's space and the tendon.becomes stuck essentially now the tests.you can do for that on the right side is.literally put your right hand on your.left shoulder and then raise your arm up.and if this is so then you've most.likely have got an impingement in the.shoulder itself or you can do the drop.arm test where the arm is you lift the.arm up using the other hand all the way.up and you bring it down and a drop arm.test this means you get to a stage where.it gets really sore actually you can't.keep it up you can't keep the arm up.itself you need to go all I've got you.have this painful arc that's a positive.sign as well for a for an

4h3V6F4Rl_k,How to self-diagnose shoulder pain from the brachial plexus with the Roos test?,"(105, 181)",show the plain stems from from your neck.so something needs to be done your your.neck the second structure that can cause.a shoulder pain is a structure that we.call the brachial plexus and thats a.structure anatomical structure consists.of nerves and blood vessels and it runs.essentially from your neck into your.shoulder and it can be get compressed.here it can be compressed by by a muscle.or can be compressed by the clavicle or.be compressed by you by the first.breakeven and the test we need to do to.determine if the brachial plexus is the.cause of your shoulder pain is what we.call the ruse test now with the boost s.what you need to do is stick your arms.up like this 90 degree in the shoulder.90 degree in the elbows then pull your.arms back a little bit so you pull your.arms a little bit and then what you do.for three minutes if you open and shut.your hands now this test is positive if.you have a heaviness or weakness in the.arms or if you get numbness and tingling.in your hands now you will get overly.tired when you do this youre looking.for four really heaviness and and the.weakness in the arms for three minutes.if thats positive then your shoulder.pain might be caused by a compression of.the brachial plexus the third structure,I we see a lot of patients in the clinic.complaining of shoulder pains and it's.not surprising actually because it's.estimated that 70% of people will will.suffer from shoulder pain at one stage.in their lives and another statistic.that's come out is that once you have.the shoulder pain almost 50% of patients.will still have it 12 months after the.onset of the pain so it's something that.persists for a long long time once you.have it hi my name is Jasper and I'm a.chiropractor at Milton a forum.chiropractic clinics were located on the.outskirts of Rosen admins and and.Cambridge and today I'd like to show you.Hugh tests so you can find out if you.have a shoulder problem what's actually.causing the shoulder problem because we.need to know what's causing it first.before we can do any give you any help.before you can give yourself any help.with it so I'm going to give you a few.tests to find out which structure is.causing the shoulder pain and we're.going to go from top to bottom.so the first structured actually caused.you a shoulder pain is your neck.shoulder pain can arise from your neck.especially if you're suffering from a.radiculopathy which is essentially a.nerve which being pinched in the neck.and you know when you have a red.radiculopathy because you have this.shooting pain from your from your neck.into your shoulder into your elbow into.your arm sort of even to your fingers.and and the tests you can do is what we.call the foramen or compression test and.what you need to do so say my right.shoulder is the effect that is the.affected side is you need to turn your.head to the right and until you had.backwards and if that reproduces your.shoulder pain this can also give you a.pain between your shoulder blades if.that reproduces it then most likely you.show the plain stems from from your neck.so something needs to be done your your.neck the second structure that can cause.a shoulder pain is a structure that we.call the brachial plexus and that's a.structure anatomical structure consists.of nerves and blood vessels and it runs.essentially from your neck into your.shoulder and it can be get compressed.here it can be compressed by by a muscle.or can be compressed by

of.the brachial plexus the third structure.can cause be sure the problem is a tear.in one of the rotator cuff muscles so.the rotator cuff muscles a muscle that.surround the joint and keep the joint.into place and I'll Shiva give you the.two most common ones the Communists the.Communists tear of a Muslim and rotator.cuff is in a muscle called the.supraspinatus and what we do for this.one is the auntie can test so what you.do with this is you straighten out your.arm you point your thumb towards the.ground so you got like a thirty degree.angle front here and then but the other.hand you apply a little bit of pressure.and you resist it and if this is so then.most likely you've got a tear in one of.the rotator cuff muscles called the.supraspinatus the other tests we can do.for another muscle part of the rotator.cuff is the infraspinatus and what you.do the tester you do to test if you have.a tear in this muscle is you put your.elbow into your side you turn your arm.out a little bit you hold it here and.with the other hand you pull and you see.if this inflicts you a pain in your.shoulder if it does it's an.infraspinatus tear in the cause in your.your shoulder problem another structure.what might cause you an issue is the.see joint and the AC joint is located on.top of your shoulder so you go if you.come up from your free upper arm you.feel like a heart structure a bony bit.and you go in about half an inch and you.feel a little bit of over over dip and.that's the AC joint that's commonly.affected with people who push weights i.weight lifters and stuff especially.would show the process up and down and.also we see a lot of traumatic events.for example with cyclists when they land.when they fall of the bike and a land on.the shoulder you often see here but.almost like a stepped effect like your.shoulder is a bit lower than your.clavicle.that's the AC joint here so the tests.you can do to determine if your pain is.actually caused by the AC joint is to.put a par test and what you do is you.interlock your fingers and you literally.just pull apart as hard as you can.now and if you get a little bit of an.ache top of your shoulder it's probably.an AC joint something can be done about.it we can help you with it but that's.where your your problem comes from the.AC joint.it could also also be a bit of.osteoarthritis you need to be overly a.bit

4h3V6F4Rl_k,How to self-diagnose shoulder pain as an injury from the rotator cuff?,"(181, 258)",pain might be caused by a compression of.the brachial plexus the third structure.can cause be sure the problem is a tear.in one of the rotator cuff muscles so.the rotator cuff muscles a muscle that.surround the joint and keep the joint.into place and Ill Shiva give you the.two most common ones the Communists the.Communists tear of a Muslim and rotator.cuff is in a muscle called the.supraspinatus and what we do for this.one is the auntie can test so what you.do with this is you straighten out your.arm you point your thumb towards the.ground so you got like a thirty degree.angle front here and then but the other.hand you apply a little bit of pressure.and you resist it and if this is so then.most likely youve got a tear in one of.the rotator cuff muscles called the.supraspinatus the other tests we can do.for another muscle part of the rotator.cuff is the infraspinatus and what you.do the tester you do to test if you have.a tear in this muscle is you put your.elbow into your side you turn your arm.out a little bit you hold it here and.with the other hand you pull and you see.if this inflicts you a pain in your.shoulder if it does its an.infraspinatus tear in the cause in your.your shoulder problem another structure,I we see a lot of patients in the clinic.complaining of shoulder pains and it's.not surprising actually because it's.estimated that 70% of people will will.suffer from shoulder pain at one stage.in their lives and another statistic.that's come out is that once you have.the shoulder pain almost 50% of patients.will still have it 12 months after the.onset of the pain so it's something that.persists for a long long time once you.have it hi my name is Jasper and I'm a.chiropractor at Milton a forum.chiropractic clinics were located on the.outskirts of Rosen admins and and.Cambridge and today I'd like to show you.Hugh tests so you can find out if you.have a shoulder problem what's actually.causing the shoulder problem because we.need to know what's causing it first.before we can do any give you any help.before you can give yourself any help.with it so I'm going to give you a few.tests to find out which structure is.causing the shoulder pain and we're.going to go from top to bottom.so the first structured actually caused.you a shoulder pain is your neck.shoulder pain can arise from your neck.especially if you're suffering from a.radiculopathy which is essentially a.nerve which being pinched in the neck.and you know when you have a red.radiculopathy because you have this.shooting pain from your from your neck.into your shoulder into your elbow into.your arm sort of even to your fingers.and and the tests you can do is what we.call the foramen or compression test and.what you need to do so say my right.shoulder is the effect that is the.affected side is you need to turn your.head to the right and until you had.backwards and if that reproduces your.shoulder pain this can also give you a.pain between your shoulder blades if.that reproduces it then most likely you.show the plain stems from from your neck.so something needs to be done your your.neck the second structure that can cause.a shoulder pain is a structure that we.call the brachial plexus and that's a.structure anatomical structure consists.of nerves and blood vessels and it runs.essentially from your neck into your.shoulder and it can be get compressed.here it can be compressed by by a muscle.or can be compressed by the clavicle or.be compressed by you by the first.breakeven and the test we need to do to.determine if the brachial plexus is the.cause of your shoulder pain is what we.call the ruse test now with the boost s.what you need to do is stick your arms.up like this 90 degree in the shoulder.90 degree in the elbows then pull your.arms back a little bit so you pull your.arms a little bit and then what you do.for three minutes if you open and shut.your hands now this test is positive if.you have a heaviness or weakness in the.arms or if you get numbness and tingling.in your hands now you will get overly.tired when you do this you're looking.for four really heaviness and and the.weakness in the arms for three minutes.if that's positive then your shoulder.pain might be caused by a compression of.the brachial plexus the third structure.can cause be sure the problem is a tear.in one of the rotator cuff muscles so.the rotator cuff muscles a muscle that.surround the joint and keep the joint.into place and I'll Shiva give you

hand you pull and you see.if this inflicts you a pain in your.shoulder if it does it's an.infraspinatus tear in the cause in your.your shoulder problem another structure.what might cause you an issue is the.see joint and the AC joint is located on.top of your shoulder so you go if you.come up from your free upper arm you.feel like a heart structure a bony bit.and you go in about half an inch and you.feel a little bit of over over dip and.that's the AC joint that's commonly.affected with people who push weights i.weight lifters and stuff especially.would show the process up and down and.also we see a lot of traumatic events.for example with cyclists when they land.when they fall of the bike and a land on.the shoulder you often see here but.almost like a stepped effect like your.shoulder

you with it but that's.where your your problem comes from the.AC joint.it could also also be a bit of.osteoarthritis you need to be overly a.bit older for that maybe having had a.trauma in the past in your shoulder a.lot of grinding goes on I'm not talking.about the occasional clicking when you.move your arm but it's the grinding.stuff that is a bit of a telltale sign.as well for osteoarthritis and you can.have an opinion an opinion is actually.one of the tendons within the shoulder.joint in the area which getting pinched.so when your your your shoulder.decreases it's space and the tendon.becomes stuck essentially now the tests.you can do for that on the right side is.literally put your right hand on your.left shoulder and then raise your arm up.and if this is so then you've most.likely have got an impingement in the.shoulder itself or you can do the drop.arm test where the arm is you lift the.arm up using the other hand all the way.up and you bring it down and a drop

4h3V6F4Rl_k,How to self-diagnose shoulder pain as an injury from the AC joint with the pull apart test?,"(258, 322)",infraspinatus tear in the cause in your.your shoulder problem another structure.what might cause you an issue is the.see joint and the AC joint is located on.top of your shoulder so you go if you.come up from your free upper arm you.feel like a heart structure a bony bit.and you go in about half an inch and you.feel a little bit of over over dip and.thats the AC joint thats commonly.affected with people who push weights i.weight lifters and stuff especially.would show the process up and down and.also we see a lot of traumatic events.for example with cyclists when they land.when they fall of the bike and a land on.the shoulder you often see here but.almost like a stepped effect like your.shoulder is a bit lower than your.clavicle.thats the AC joint here so the tests.you can do to determine if your pain is.actually caused by the AC joint is to.put a par test and what you do is you.interlock your fingers and you literally.just pull apart as hard as you can.now and if you get a little bit of an.ache top of your shoulder its probably.an AC joint something can be done about.it we can help you with it but thats.where your your problem comes from the.AC joint,I we see a lot of patients in the clinic.complaining of shoulder pains and it's.not surprising actually because it's.estimated that 70% of people will will.suffer from shoulder pain at one stage.in their lives and another statistic.that's come out is that once you have.the shoulder pain almost 50% of patients.will still have it 12 months after the.onset of the pain so it's something that.persists for a long long time once you.have it hi my name is Jasper and I'm a.chiropractor at Milton a forum.chiropractic clinics were located on the.outskirts of Rosen admins and and.Cambridge and today I'd like to show you.Hugh tests so you can find out if you.have a shoulder problem what's actually.causing the shoulder problem because we.need to know what's causing it first.before we can do any give you any help.before you can give yourself any help.with it so I'm going to give you a few.tests to find out which structure is.causing the shoulder pain and we're.going to go from top to bottom.so the first structured actually caused.you a shoulder pain is your neck.shoulder pain can arise from your neck.especially if you're suffering from a.radiculopathy which is essentially a.nerve which being pinched in the neck.and you know when you have a red.radiculopathy because you have this.shooting pain from your from your neck.into your shoulder into your elbow into.your arm sort of even to your fingers.and and the tests you can do is what we.call the foramen or compression test and.what you need to do so say my right.shoulder is the effect that is the.affected side is you need to turn your.head to the right and until you had.backwards and if that reproduces your.shoulder pain this can also give you a.pain between your shoulder blades if.that reproduces it then most likely you.show the plain stems from from your neck.so something needs to be done your your.neck the second structure that can cause.a shoulder pain is a structure that we.call the brachial plexus and that's a.structure anatomical structure consists.of nerves and blood vessels and it runs.essentially from your neck into your.shoulder and it can be get compressed.here it can be compressed by by a muscle.or can be compressed by the clavicle or.be compressed by you by the first.breakeven and the test we need to do to.determine if the brachial plexus is the.cause of your shoulder pain is what we.call the ruse test now with the boost s.what you need to do is stick your arms.up like this 90 degree in the shoulder.90 degree in the elbows then pull your.arms back a little bit so you pull your.arms a little bit and then what you do.for three minutes if you open and shut.your hands now this test is positive if.you have a heaviness or weakness in the.arms or if you get numbness and tingling.in your hands now you will get overly.tired when you do this you're looking.for four really heaviness and and the.weakness in the arms for three minutes.if that's positive then your shoulder.pain might be caused by a compression of.the brachial plexus the third structure.can cause be sure the problem is a tear.in one of the rotator cuff muscles so.the rotator cuff muscles a muscle that.surround the joint and keep the joint.into place and I'll Shiva give you the.two most common ones the Communists the.Communists tear of a Muslim and rotator.cuff is in a muscle called the.supraspinatus and what we do for this.one is the auntie can test so what you.do with this is you straighten out your.arm you point your thumb towards the.ground so you got like a thirty degree.angle front here and then but the other.hand you apply a little bit of pressure.and you resist it and if this is so then.most likely you've got a tear in one of.the rotator cuff muscles called the.supraspinatus the other tests we can do.for another muscle part of the rotator.cuff is the infraspinatus and what you.do the tester you do to test if you have.a tear in this muscle is you put your.elbow into your side you turn your arm.out a little bit you hold it here and.with the other hand you pull and you see.if this inflicts you a pain in your.shoulder if it does it's an.infraspinatus tear in the cause in your.your shoulder problem another structure.what might cause you an issue is the.see joint and the AC joint is located on.top of your shoulder so you go if you.come up from your free upper arm you.feel like a heart structure a bony bit.and you go in about half an inch and you.feel a little bit of over over dip

an opinion an opinion is actually.one of the tendons within the shoulder.joint in the area which getting pinched.so when your your your shoulder.decreases it's space and the tendon.becomes stuck essentially now the tests.you can do for that on the right side is.literally put your right hand on your.left shoulder and then raise your arm up.and if this is so then you've most.likely have got an impingement in the.shoulder itself or you can do the drop.arm test where the arm is you lift the.arm up using the other hand all the way.up and you bring it down and a drop arm.test this means you get to a stage where.it gets really sore actually you can't.keep it up you can't keep the arm up.itself you need to go all I've got you.have this painful arc that's a positive.sign as well for a for an

4h3V6F4Rl_k,How to self-diagnose shoulder pain as shoulder impingement?,"(322, 386)",where your your problem comes from the.AC joint.it could also also be a bit of.osteoarthritis you need to be overly a.bit older for that maybe having had a.trauma in the past in your shoulder a.lot of grinding goes on Im not talking.about the occasional clicking when you.move your arm but its the grinding.stuff that is a bit of a telltale sign.as well for osteoarthritis and you can.have an opinion an opinion is actually.one of the tendons within the shoulder.joint in the area which getting pinched.so when your your your shoulder.decreases its space and the tendon.becomes stuck essentially now the tests.you can do for that on the right side is.literally put your right hand on your.left shoulder and then raise your arm up.and if this is so then youve most.likely have got an impingement in the.shoulder itself or you can do the drop.arm test where the arm is you lift the.arm up using the other hand all the way.up and you bring it down and a drop arm.test this means you get to a stage where.it gets really sore actually you cant.keep it up you cant keep the arm up.itself you need to go all Ive got you.have this painful arc thats a positive.sign as well for a for an opinion go so,I we see a lot of patients in the clinic.complaining of shoulder pains and it's.not surprising actually because it's.estimated that 70% of people will will.suffer from shoulder pain at one stage.in their lives and another statistic.that's come out is that once you have.the shoulder pain almost 50% of patients.will still have it 12 months after the.onset of the pain so it's something that.persists for a long long time once you.have it hi my name is Jasper and I'm a.chiropractor at Milton a forum.chiropractic clinics were located on the.outskirts of Rosen admins and and.Cambridge and today I'd like to show you.Hugh tests so you can find out if you.have a shoulder problem what's actually.causing the shoulder problem because we.need to know what's causing it first.before we can do any give you any help.before you can give yourself any help.with it so I'm going to give you a few.tests to find out which structure is.causing the shoulder pain and we're.going to go from top to bottom.so the first structured actually caused.you a shoulder pain is your neck.shoulder pain can arise from your neck.especially if you're suffering from a.radiculopathy which is essentially a.nerve which being pinched in the neck.and you know when you have a red.radiculopathy because you have this.shooting pain from your from your neck.into your shoulder into your elbow into.your arm sort of even to your fingers.and and the tests you can do is what we.call the foramen or compression test and.what you need to do so say my right.shoulder is the effect that is the.affected side is you need to turn your.head to the right and until you had.backwards and if that reproduces your.shoulder pain this can also give you a.pain between your shoulder blades if.that reproduces it then most likely you.show the plain stems from from your neck.so something needs to be done your your.neck the second structure that can cause.a shoulder pain is a structure that we.call the brachial plexus and that's a.structure anatomical structure consists.of nerves and blood vessels and it runs.essentially from your neck into your.shoulder and it can be get compressed.here it can be compressed by by a muscle.or can be compressed by the clavicle or.be compressed by you by the first.breakeven and the test we need to do to.determine if the brachial plexus is the.cause of your shoulder pain is what we.call the ruse test now with the boost s.what you need to do is stick your arms.up like this 90 degree in the shoulder.90 degree in the elbows then pull your.arms back a little bit so you pull your.arms a little bit and then what you do.for three minutes if you open and shut.your hands now this test is positive if.you have a heaviness or weakness in the.arms or if you get numbness and tingling.in your hands now you will get overly.tired when you do this you're looking.for four really heaviness and and the.weakness in the arms for three minutes.if that's positive then your shoulder.pain might be caused by a compression of.the brachial plexus the third structure.can cause be sure the problem is a tear.in one of the rotator cuff muscles so.the rotator cuff muscles a muscle that.surround the joint and keep the joint.into place and I'll Shiva give you the.two most common ones the Communists the.Communists tear of a Muslim and rotator.cuff is in a muscle called the.supraspinatus and what we do for this.one is the auntie can test so what you.do with this is you straighten out your.arm you point your thumb towards the.ground so you got like a thirty degree.angle front here and then but the other.hand you apply a little bit of pressure.and you resist it and if this is so then.most likely you've got a tear in one of.the rotator cuff muscles called the.supraspinatus the other tests we can do.for another muscle part of the rotator.cuff is the infraspinatus and what you.do the tester you do to test if you have.a tear in this muscle is you put your.elbow into your side you turn your arm.out a little bit you hold it here and.with the other hand you pull and you see.if this inflicts you a pain in your.shoulder if it does it's an.infraspinatus tear in the cause in your.your shoulder problem another structure.what might cause you an issue is the.see joint and the AC joint is located on.top of your shoulder so you go if you.come up from your free upper arm you.feel like a heart structure a bony bit.and you go in about half an inch and you.feel a little bit of over over dip and.that's the AC joint that's commonly.affected with people who push weights i.weight lifters and stuff especially.would show the process up and down and.also we see a lot of traumatic events.for example with cyclists when they land.when they fall of the bike and a land on.the shoulder you often see here but.almost like a stepped effect like your.shoulder is a bit lower than your.clavicle.that's the AC joint here so the tests.you can do to determine if your pain is.actually caused by the AC joint is to.put a par test and what you do is you.interlock your fingers and you literally.just pull apart as hard as you can.now and if you get a little bit of an.ache top of your shoulder it's probably.an AC joint something can be done about.it we can help you with it but that's.where your your problem comes from the.AC joint.it could also also be a bit of.osteoarthritis you need to be overly a.bit older for that maybe having had a.trauma in the past in your shoulder

vgW6ZD_QwwQ,How to get rid of leg swelling by doing exercise with a leg wedge?,"(93, 129)",So we wanna get the thing is.if you wanna get rid of fluid.its not gonna go out your toes.Its gotta go back up into your truck.where it gets processed and then it gets expelled.from the body.In other words you urinate or pee it out. Right. To be graphic.We gotta get the fluid back up into this area.so thats why it works really well.if you can take a leg wedge.we often recommend this for back pain too.Or if you just take some pillows and put them.underneath your feet.and get your feet up higher.than your heart if possible.Thats doing a pretty good job.But also you can do these in a seated position,"(intro music).Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, a physical therapist.I can say it.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.Because we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion of course, Bob.Now what threw me off, Brad,.is I'm on the right side here,.I'm not used to being over here.It even throws my language off.Well don't worry about it, Bob,.you have to get used to it.Today, Top Seven Exercises for Leg Edema, or Swelling.This is a program or protocol that we actually use.for patients that, when they have leg edema,.and they're going home,.these are the exercises they can do.You can do them in bed, or you can do them seated.We're gonna show you both ways.It's actually better to do them in bed.Gravity's working with you.Gravity's working with you, right.But before we do that, if you're new to our channel,.please take a second to subscribe to us.We provide videos on staying healthy, fit, pain free,.and we upload every day.Brad's really gonna be the lazy man on this video.That's right.But you can also join us,.we're always giving away something.We don't know what we're giving away right now, do we?.No, we're giving away something, though.If you join us, go to our Facebook page,.it's pinned to the top of our page.If you go to BobandBradcom,.it's under our section Giveaways.Don't miss out on it.All we need is your name and email.Oh you wanna do it, huh?.I wanna get rid of it, Bob, I've got a place for it.Alright, good for you.Alright, so with edema, or swelling.What often is gravity is pulling fluid from everywhere.in your body, and it often settles.in your calf, and ankles, and feet.So we wanna get, the thing is,.if you wanna get rid of fluid,.it's not gonna go out your toes.It's gotta go back up into your truck,.where it gets processed, and then it gets expelled.from the body.In other words, you urinate, or pee, it out.Right.To be graphic.We gotta get the fluid back up into this area,.so that's why it works really well.if you can take a leg wedge,.we often recommend this for back pain, too.Or if you just take some pillows and put them.underneath your feet,.and get your feet up higher.than your heart if possible.That's doing a pretty good job.But also, you can do these in a seated position.They're still gonna help.They just won't be quite as effective.Sure.So we got the Seven Exercises, let's get started, Brad.Before we do,.quite often you wanna do a little bit.of deep diaphragmatic breathing,.which kind of clears the area here.If you know how to do diaphragmatic breathing,.or as a review,.when you breath in, your abdomen is actually expanding,.and that opens up the diaphragm.So when Brad breaths in, you can see how it's expanding.When he breaths out, it actually goes down.That's the opposite of what people quite often think.A lot of times they think,.When I breath in my chest should go up,.and it's actually, you want your diaphragm to go out.So five quick breaths,.and then we go on and start the exercises.So the first one,.just to get a little movement in the abdomen here,.we're actually just gonna do flexing forward here,.for five times.I'm sorry, these are all 10-15 times, actually,.let's stick with 15 times.Okay.Yep.So you're just gonna come forward a little bit here.Very easy to do.15 times.We'll say we're up to 15, alright?.Sure.So people can follow along.Number two, you're actually gonna rotate the trunk.using your hips.Brad's gonna go ahead and do that.He's gonna use the hips,.I'm actually gonna rotate like this, in the chair,.going back and forth.You're gonna put your hands together like this.Again the idea is you're going.Well why am I,.I'm trying to get fluid out of my legs,.why am I working on my trunk?.You've gotta clear the drain, basically.Right.If the drain is plugged,.the fluid is not gonna be able.to go up into the body and be processed.One metaphor, or whatever,.that I heard from Aaron, who's certified,.he said imagine your bellybutton is the drain,.and that's where the fluid has to get up to.So we wanna clear the area here first,.so it's not like a dam preventing that fluid.from your legs and ankles to come up this way.We're starting here and working down that way.I've definitely seen that on patients.where there was a dam.Actually once we cleared it up here,.the fluid started to go down.Alright next one, Brad, is butt squeezes.On this one you're not gonna be able to see me do it really,.but I'm just squeezing my butt together.Again, you wanna hold it for like three seconds,.and we're gonna go up to 15.Okay next one,.marching in place.So Brad, he's just doing hip flexion, unilaterally,.going back and forth.Good, 15 times, you got it, number?.Oh yeah, we're good.Then we do kick outs.There you go, yep.Excellent.Brad, you're a good student.Well, I've been practicing, Bob.Yeah.I really would like to say,.you can certainly use pillows,.but if you're gonna be doing this for any length of time,.this leg wedger's not that expensive,.and it's much more comfortable, and they work better.than a pillow, for sure.You wanna make sure that's linked down below,.that they know where to get that,.because this is a handy thing.that you could even fall asleep on if you have edema.And that would help matters.Next one, just do some ankle pumps.I'm doing alternating, Brad's doing,.well you were.Either way.Well, I like doing alternating,.but I can do it think way, too.This is one you can do throughout the day,.even when you're standing,.you can do some ankle pumps like this.And the final one is just wiggle your toes.Yep.Just start wiggling the toes.This little piggy went to the market, right Brad?.Oh, Bob, why Bob?.Why?.This little piggy said.Why Bob, why Bob, all the way home.But you can clearly see, we started with these,.and we worked the muscles here,.and we just went down the way.To be honest, Brad, what you should do.is you wanna go that way,.and the next time, if you wanna do a full thing,.you go down and then come back again.Or the next time, start at the toes, and then go all up.Okay.So, just to mix it up a little bit,.and get the fluid moving, so.Good luck with your edema.Hopefully we're gonna get that resolved.Remember, Brad and I can fix just about anything.Except for.A broken heart,.put it right over Brad.Yeah.(imitates heartbeat).pounding away.Alright, thanks for watching","{'(66.24, 67.83)': 'please take a second to subscribe to us',

vgW6ZD_QwwQ,How should you do trunk flexes for leg edema?,"(180, 201)",for five times.Im sorry these are all 1015 times actually.lets stick with 15 times. Okay.Yep. So youre just gonna come forward a little bit here.Very easy to do.15 times.Well say were up to 15 alright. Sure. So people can follow along.Number two youre actually gonna rotate the trunk,"(intro music).Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, a physical therapist.I can say it.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.Because we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion of course, Bob.Now what threw me off, Brad,.is I'm on the right side here,.I'm not used to being over here.It even throws my language off.Well don't worry about it, Bob,.you have to get used to it.Today, Top Seven Exercises for Leg Edema, or Swelling.This is a program or protocol that we actually use.for patients that, when they have leg edema,.and they're going home,.these are the exercises they can do.You can do them in bed, or you can do them seated.We're gonna show you both ways.It's actually better to do them in bed.Gravity's working with you.Gravity's working with you, right.But before we do that, if you're new to our channel,.please take a second to subscribe to us.We provide videos on staying healthy, fit, pain free,.and we upload every day.Brad's really gonna be the lazy man on this video.That's right.But you can also join us,.we're always giving away something.We don't know what we're giving away right now, do we?.No, we're giving away something, though.If you join us, go to our Facebook page,.it's pinned to the top of our page.If you go to BobandBradcom,.it's under our section Giveaways.Don't miss out on it.All we need is your name and email.Oh you wanna do it, huh?.I wanna get rid of it, Bob, I've got a place for it.Alright, good for you.Alright, so with edema, or swelling.What often is gravity is pulling fluid from everywhere.in your body, and it often settles.in your calf, and ankles, and feet.So we wanna get, the thing is,.if you wanna get rid of fluid,.it's not gonna go out your toes.It's gotta go back up into your truck,.where it gets processed, and then it gets expelled.from the body.In other words, you urinate, or pee, it out.Right.To be graphic.We gotta get the fluid back up into this area,.so that's why it works really well.if you can take a leg wedge,.we often recommend this for back pain, too.Or if you just take some pillows and put them.underneath your feet,.and get your feet up higher.than your heart if possible.That's doing a pretty good job.But also, you can do these in a seated position.They're still gonna help.They just won't be quite as effective.Sure.So we got the Seven Exercises, let's get started, Brad.Before we do,.quite often you wanna do a little bit.of deep diaphragmatic breathing,.which kind of clears the area here.If you know how to do diaphragmatic breathing,.or as a review,.when you breath in, your abdomen is actually expanding,.and that opens up the diaphragm.So when Brad breaths in, you can see how it's expanding.When he breaths out, it actually goes down.That's the opposite of what people quite often think.A lot of times they think,.When I breath in my chest should go up,.and it's actually, you want your diaphragm to go out.So five quick breaths,.and then we go on and start the exercises.So the first one,.just to get a little movement in the abdomen here,.we're actually just gonna do flexing forward here,.for five times.I'm sorry, these are all 10-15 times, actually,.let's stick with 15 times.Okay.Yep.So you're just gonna come forward a little bit here.Very easy to do.15 times.We'll say we're up to 15, alright?.Sure.So people can follow along.Number two, you're actually gonna rotate the trunk.using your hips.Brad's gonna go ahead and do that.He's gonna use the hips,.I'm actually gonna rotate like this, in the chair,.going back and forth.You're gonna put your hands together like this.Again the idea is you're going.Well why am I,.I'm trying to get fluid out of my legs,.why am I working on my trunk?.You've gotta clear the drain, basically.Right.If the drain is plugged,.the fluid is not gonna be able.to go up into the body and be processed.One metaphor, or whatever,.that I heard from Aaron, who's certified,.he said imagine your bellybutton is the drain,.and that's where the fluid has to get up to.So we wanna clear the area here first,.so it's not like a dam preventing that fluid.from your legs and ankles to come up this way.We're starting here and working down that way.I've definitely seen that on patients.where there was a dam.Actually once we cleared it up here,.the fluid started to go down.Alright next one, Brad, is butt squeezes.On this one you're not gonna be able to see me do it really,.but I'm just squeezing my butt together.Again, you wanna hold it for like three seconds,.and we're gonna go up to 15.Okay next one,.marching in place.So Brad, he's just doing hip flexion, unilaterally,.going back and forth.Good, 15 times, you got it, number?.Oh yeah, we're good.Then we do kick outs.There you go, yep.Excellent.Brad, you're a good student.Well, I've been practicing, Bob.Yeah.I really would like to say,.you can certainly use pillows,.but if you're gonna be doing this for any length of time,.this leg wedger's not that expensive,.and it's much more comfortable, and they work better.than a pillow, for sure.You wanna make sure that's linked down below,.that they know where to get that,.because this is a handy thing.that you could even fall asleep on if you have edema.And that would help matters.Next one, just do some ankle pumps.I'm doing alternating, Brad's doing,.well you were.Either way.Well, I like doing alternating,.but I can do it think way, too.This is one you can do throughout the day,.even when you're standing,.you can do some ankle pumps like this.And the final one is just wiggle your toes.Yep.Just start wiggling the toes.This little piggy went to the market, right Brad?.Oh, Bob, why Bob?.Why?.This little piggy said.Why Bob, why Bob, all the way home.But you can clearly see, we started with these,.and we worked the muscles here,.and we just went down the way.To be honest, Brad, what you should do.is you wanna go that way,.and the next time, if you wanna do a full thing,.you go down and then come back again.Or the next time, start at the toes, and then go all up.Okay.So, just to mix it up a little bit,.and get the fluid moving, so.Good luck with your edema.Hopefully we're gonna get that resolved.Remember, Brad and I can fix just about anything.Except for.A broken heart,.put it right over Brad.Yeah.(imitates heartbeat).pounding away.Alright, thanks for watching","{'(66.24, 67.83)': 'please take a second to subscribe to us', '(155.634, 156.46699999999998)':  'Right', '(27.45, 28.53)':

vgW6ZD_QwwQ,How should you do trunk rotations exercise for leg edema?,"(206, 235)",Hes gonna use the hips.Im actually gonna rotate like this in the chair.going back and forth.Youre gonna put your hands together like this.Again the idea is youre going.Well why am I.Im trying to get fluid out of my legs.why am I working on my trunk.Youve gotta clear the drain basically. Right. If the drain is plugged.the fluid is not gonna be able.to go up into the body and be processed. One metaphor or whatever.that I heard from Aaron whos certified,"(intro music).Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, a physical therapist.I can say it.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.Because we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion of course, Bob.Now what threw me off, Brad,.is I'm on the right side here,.I'm not used to being over here.It even throws my language off.Well don't worry about it, Bob,.you have to get used to it.Today, Top Seven Exercises for Leg Edema, or Swelling.This is a program or protocol that we actually use.for patients that, when they have leg edema,.and they're going home,.these are the exercises they can do.You can do them in bed, or you can do them seated.We're gonna show you both ways.It's actually better to do them in bed.Gravity's working with you.Gravity's working with you, right.But before we do that, if you're new to our channel,.please take a second to subscribe to us.We provide videos on staying healthy, fit, pain free,.and we upload every day.Brad's really gonna be the lazy man on this video.That's right.But you can also join us,.we're always giving away something.We don't know what we're giving away right now, do we?.No, we're giving away something, though.If you join us, go to our Facebook page,.it's pinned to the top of our page.If you go to BobandBradcom,.it's under our section Giveaways.Don't miss out on it.All we need is your name and email.Oh you wanna do it, huh?.I wanna get rid of it, Bob, I've got a place for it.Alright, good for you.Alright, so with edema, or swelling.What often is gravity is pulling fluid from everywhere.in your body, and it often settles.in your calf, and ankles, and feet.So we wanna get, the thing is,.if you wanna get rid of fluid,.it's not gonna go out your toes.It's gotta go back up into your truck,.where it gets processed, and then it gets expelled.from the body.In other words, you urinate, or pee, it out.Right.To be graphic.We gotta get the fluid back up into this area,.so that's why it works really well.if you can take a leg wedge,.we often recommend this for back pain, too.Or if you just take some pillows and put them.underneath your feet,.and get your feet up higher.than your heart if possible.That's doing a pretty good job.But also, you can do these in a seated position.They're still gonna help.They just won't be quite as effective.Sure.So we got the Seven Exercises, let's get started, Brad.Before we do,.quite often you wanna do a little bit.of deep diaphragmatic breathing,.which kind of clears the area here.If you know how to do diaphragmatic breathing,.or as a review,.when you breath in, your abdomen is actually expanding,.and that opens up the diaphragm.So when Brad breaths in, you can see how it's expanding.When he breaths out, it actually goes down.That's the opposite of what people quite often think.A lot of times they think,.When I breath in my chest should go up,.and it's actually, you want your diaphragm to go out.So five quick breaths,.and then we go on and start the exercises.So the first one,.just to get a little movement in the abdomen here,.we're actually just gonna do flexing forward here,.for five times.I'm sorry, these are all 10-15 times, actually,.let's stick with 15 times.Okay.Yep.So you're just gonna come forward a little bit here.Very easy to do.15 times.We'll say we're up to 15, alright?.Sure.So people can follow along.Number two, you're actually gonna rotate the trunk.using your hips.Brad's gonna go ahead and do that.He's gonna use the hips,.I'm actually gonna rotate like this, in the chair,.going back and forth.You're gonna put your hands together like this.Again the idea is you're going.Well why am I,.I'm trying to get fluid out of my legs,.why am I working on my trunk?.You've gotta clear the drain, basically.Right.If the drain is plugged,.the fluid is not gonna be able.to go up into the body and be processed.One metaphor, or whatever,.that I heard from Aaron, who's certified,.he said imagine your bellybutton is the drain,.and that's where the fluid has to get up to.So we wanna clear the area here first,.so it's not like a dam preventing that fluid.from your legs and ankles to come up this way.We're starting here and working down that way.I've definitely seen that on patients.where there was a dam.Actually once we cleared it up here,.the fluid started to go down.Alright next one, Brad, is butt squeezes.On this one you're not gonna be able to see me do it really,.but I'm just squeezing my butt together.Again, you wanna hold it for like three seconds,.and we're gonna go up to 15.Okay next one,.marching in place.So Brad, he's just doing hip flexion, unilaterally,.going back and forth.Good, 15 times, you got it, number?.Oh yeah, we're good.Then we do kick outs.There you go, yep.Excellent.Brad, you're a good student.Well, I've been practicing, Bob.Yeah.I really would like to say,.you can certainly use pillows,.but if you're gonna be doing this for any length of time,.this leg wedger's not that expensive,.and it's much more comfortable, and they work better.than a pillow, for sure.You wanna make sure that's linked down below,.that they know where to get that,.because this is a handy thing.that you could even fall asleep on if you have edema.And that would help matters.Next one, just do some ankle pumps.I'm doing alternating, Brad's doing,.well you were.Either way.Well, I like doing alternating,.but I can do it think way, too.This is one you can do throughout the day,.even when you're standing,.you can do some ankle pumps like this.And the final one is just wiggle your toes.Yep.Just start wiggling the toes.This little piggy went to the market, right Brad?.Oh, Bob, why Bob?.Why?.This little piggy said.Why Bob, why Bob, all the way home.But you can clearly see, we started with these,.and we worked the muscles here,.and we just went down the way.To be honest, Brad, what you should do.is you wanna go that way,.and the next time, if you wanna do a full thing,.you go down and then come back again.Or the next time, start at the toes, and then go all up.Okay.So, just to mix it up a little bit,.and get the fluid moving, so.Good luck with your edema.Hopefully we're gonna get that resolved.Remember, Brad and I can fix just about anything.Except for.A broken heart,.put it right over Brad.Yeah.(imitates heartbeat).pounding away.Alright, thanks for watching","{'(66.24, 67.83)': 'please take a second to subscribe to us', '(155.634, 156.46699999999998)':  'Right', '(27.45, 28.53)':

vgW6ZD_QwwQ,How should you do butt squeezes exercise for leg edema?,"(265, 274)",but Im just squeezing my butt together.Again you wanna hold it for like three seconds.and were gonna go up to 15.Okay next one,"(intro music).Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, a physical therapist.I can say it.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.Because we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion of course, Bob.Now what threw me off, Brad,.is I'm on the right side here,.I'm not used to being over here.It even throws my language off.Well don't worry about it, Bob,.you have to get used to it.Today, Top Seven Exercises for Leg Edema, or Swelling.This is a program or protocol that we actually use.for patients that, when they have leg edema,.and they're going home,.these are the exercises they can do.You can do them in bed, or you can do them seated.We're gonna show you both ways.It's actually better to do them in bed.Gravity's working with you.Gravity's working with you, right.But before we do that, if you're new to our channel,.please take a second to subscribe to us.We provide videos on staying healthy, fit, pain free,.and we upload every day.Brad's really gonna be the lazy man on this video.That's right.But you can also join us,.we're always giving away something.We don't know what we're giving away right now, do we?.No, we're giving away something, though.If you join us, go to our Facebook page,.it's pinned to the top of our page.If you go to BobandBradcom,.it's under our section Giveaways.Don't miss out on it.All we need is your name and email.Oh you wanna do it, huh?.I wanna get rid of it, Bob, I've got a place for it.Alright, good for you.Alright, so with edema, or swelling.What often is gravity is pulling fluid from everywhere.in your body, and it often settles.in your calf, and ankles, and feet.So we wanna get, the thing is,.if you wanna get rid of fluid,.it's not gonna go out your toes.It's gotta go back up into your truck,.where it gets processed, and then it gets expelled.from the body.In other words, you urinate, or pee, it out.Right.To be graphic.We gotta get the fluid back up into this area,.so that's why it works really well.if you can take a leg wedge,.we often recommend this for back pain, too.Or if you just take some pillows and put them.underneath your feet,.and get your feet up higher.than your heart if possible.That's doing a pretty good job.But also, you can do these in a seated position.They're still gonna help.They just won't be quite as effective.Sure.So we got the Seven Exercises, let's get started, Brad.Before we do,.quite often you wanna do a little bit.of deep diaphragmatic breathing,.which kind of clears the area here.If you know how to do diaphragmatic breathing,.or as a review,.when you breath in, your abdomen is actually expanding,.and that opens up the diaphragm.So when Brad breaths in, you can see how it's expanding.When he breaths out, it actually goes down.That's the opposite of what people quite often think.A lot of times they think,.When I breath in my chest should go up,.and it's actually, you want your diaphragm to go out.So five quick breaths,.and then we go on and start the exercises.So the first one,.just to get a little movement in the abdomen here,.we're actually just gonna do flexing forward here,.for five times.I'm sorry, these are all 10-15 times, actually,.let's stick with 15 times.Okay.Yep.So you're just gonna come forward a little bit here.Very easy to do.15 times.We'll say we're up to 15, alright?.Sure.So people can follow along.Number two, you're actually gonna rotate the trunk.using your hips.Brad's gonna go ahead and do that.He's gonna use the hips,.I'm actually gonna rotate like this, in the chair,.going back and forth.You're gonna put your hands together like this.Again the idea is you're going.Well why am I,.I'm trying to get fluid out of my legs,.why am I working on my trunk?.You've gotta clear the drain, basically.Right.If the drain is plugged,.the fluid is not gonna be able.to go up into the body and be processed.One metaphor, or whatever,.that I heard from Aaron, who's certified,.he said imagine your bellybutton is the drain,.and that's where the fluid has to get up to.So we wanna clear the area here first,.so it's not like a dam preventing that fluid.from your legs and ankles to come up this way.We're starting here and working down that way.I've definitely seen that on patients.where there was a dam.Actually once we cleared it up here,.the fluid started to go down.Alright next one, Brad, is butt squeezes.On this one you're not gonna be able to see me do it really,.but I'm just squeezing my butt together.Again, you wanna hold it for like three seconds,.and we're gonna go up to 15.Okay next one,.marching in place.So Brad, he's just doing hip flexion, unilaterally,.going back and forth.Good, 15 times, you got it, number?.Oh yeah, we're good.Then we do kick outs.There you go, yep.Excellent.Brad, you're a good student.Well, I've been practicing, Bob.Yeah.I really would like to say,.you can certainly use pillows,.but if you're gonna be doing this for any length of time,.this leg wedger's not that expensive,.and it's much more comfortable, and they work better.than a pillow, for sure.You wanna make sure that's linked down below,.that they know where to get that,.because this is a handy thing.that you could even fall asleep on if you have edema.And that would help matters.Next one, just do some ankle pumps.I'm doing alternating, Brad's doing,.well you were.Either way.Well, I like doing alternating,.but I can do it think way, too.This is one you can do throughout the day,.even when you're standing,.you can do some ankle pumps like this.And the final one is just wiggle your toes.Yep.Just start wiggling the toes.This little piggy went to the market, right Brad?.Oh, Bob, why Bob?.Why?.This little piggy said.Why Bob, why Bob, all the way home.But you can clearly see, we started with these,.and we worked the muscles here,.and we just went down the way.To be honest, Brad, what you should do.is you wanna go that way,.and the next time, if you wanna do a full thing,.you go down and then come back again.Or the next time, start at the toes, and then go all up.Okay.So, just to mix it up a little bit,.and get the fluid moving, so.Good luck with your edema.Hopefully we're gonna get that resolved.Remember, Brad and I can fix just about anything.Except for.A broken heart,.put it right over Brad.Yeah.(imitates heartbeat).pounding away.Alright, thanks for

vgW6ZD_QwwQ,How should you do marching in place exercise for leg edema?,"(276, 289)",So Brad hes just doing hip flexion unilaterally.going back and forth.Good 15 times you got it number. Oh yeah were good,"(intro music).Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, a physical therapist.I can say it.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.Because we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion of course, Bob.Now what threw me off, Brad,.is I'm on the right side here,.I'm not used to being over here.It even throws my language off.Well don't worry about it, Bob,.you have to get used to it.Today, Top Seven Exercises for Leg Edema, or Swelling.This is a program or protocol that we actually use.for patients that, when they have leg edema,.and they're going home,.these are the exercises they can do.You can do them in bed, or you can do them seated.We're gonna show you both ways.It's actually better to do them in bed.Gravity's working with you.Gravity's working with you, right.But before we do that, if you're new to our channel,.please take a second to subscribe to us.We provide videos on staying healthy, fit, pain free,.and we upload every day.Brad's really gonna be the lazy man on this video.That's right.But you can also join us,.we're always giving away something.We don't know what we're giving away right now, do we?.No, we're giving away something, though.If you join us, go to our Facebook page,.it's pinned to the top of our page.If you go to BobandBradcom,.it's under our section Giveaways.Don't miss out on it.All we need is your name and email.Oh you wanna do it, huh?.I wanna get rid of it, Bob, I've got a place for it.Alright, good for you.Alright, so with edema, or swelling.What often is gravity is pulling fluid from everywhere.in your body, and it often settles.in your calf, and ankles, and feet.So we wanna get, the thing is,.if you wanna get rid of fluid,.it's not gonna go out your toes.It's gotta go back up into your truck,.where it gets processed, and then it gets expelled.from the body.In other words, you urinate, or pee, it out.Right.To be graphic.We gotta get the fluid back up into this area,.so that's why it works really well.if you can take a leg wedge,.we often recommend this for back pain, too.Or if you just take some pillows and put them.underneath your feet,.and get your feet up higher.than your heart if possible.That's doing a pretty good job.But also, you can do these in a seated position.They're still gonna help.They just won't be quite as effective.Sure.So we got the Seven Exercises, let's get started, Brad.Before we do,.quite often you wanna do a little bit.of deep diaphragmatic breathing,.which kind of clears the area here.If you know how to do diaphragmatic breathing,.or as a review,.when you breath in, your abdomen is actually expanding,.and that opens up the diaphragm.So when Brad breaths in, you can see how it's expanding.When he breaths out, it actually goes down.That's the opposite of what people quite often think.A lot of times they think,.When I breath in my chest should go up,.and it's actually, you want your diaphragm to go out.So five quick breaths,.and then we go on and start the exercises.So the first one,.just to get a little movement in the abdomen here,.we're actually just gonna do flexing forward here,.for five times.I'm sorry, these are all 10-15 times, actually,.let's stick with 15 times.Okay.Yep.So you're just gonna come forward a little bit here.Very easy to do.15 times.We'll say we're up to 15, alright?.Sure.So people can follow along.Number two, you're actually gonna rotate the trunk.using your hips.Brad's gonna go ahead and do that.He's gonna use the hips,.I'm actually gonna rotate like this, in the chair,.going back and forth.You're gonna put your hands together like this.Again the idea is you're going.Well why am I,.I'm trying to get fluid out of my legs,.why am I working on my trunk?.You've gotta clear the drain, basically.Right.If the drain is plugged,.the fluid is not gonna be able.to go up into the body and be processed.One metaphor, or whatever,.that I heard from Aaron, who's certified,.he said imagine your bellybutton is the drain,.and that's where the fluid has to get up to.So we wanna clear the area here first,.so it's not like a dam preventing that fluid.from your legs and ankles to come up this way.We're starting here and working down that way.I've definitely seen that on patients.where there was a dam.Actually once we cleared it up here,.the fluid started to go down.Alright next one, Brad, is butt squeezes.On this one you're not gonna be able to see me do it really,.but I'm just squeezing my butt together.Again, you wanna hold it for like three seconds,.and we're gonna go up to 15.Okay next one,.marching in place.So Brad, he's just doing hip flexion, unilaterally,.going back and forth.Good, 15 times, you got it, number?.Oh yeah, we're good.Then we do kick outs.There you go, yep.Excellent.Brad, you're a good student.Well, I've been practicing, Bob.Yeah.I really would like to say,.you can certainly use pillows,.but if you're gonna be doing this for any length of time,.this leg wedger's not that expensive,.and it's much more comfortable, and they work better.than a pillow, for sure.You wanna make sure that's linked down below,.that they know where to get that,.because this is a handy thing.that you could even fall asleep on if you have edema.And that would help matters.Next one, just do some ankle pumps.I'm doing alternating, Brad's doing,.well you were.Either way.Well, I like doing alternating,.but I can do it think way, too.This is one you can do throughout the day,.even when you're standing,.you can do some ankle pumps like this.And the final one is just wiggle your toes.Yep.Just start wiggling the toes.This little piggy went to the market, right Brad?.Oh, Bob, why Bob?.Why?.This little piggy said.Why Bob, why Bob, all the way home.But you can clearly see, we started with these,.and we worked the muscles here,.and we just went down the way.To be honest, Brad, what you should do.is you wanna go that way,.and the next time, if you wanna do a full thing,.you go down and then come back again.Or the next time, start at the toes, and then go all up.Okay.So, just to mix it up a little bit,.and get the fluid moving, so.Good luck with your edema.Hopefully we're gonna get that resolved.Remember, Brad and I can fix just about anything.Except for.A broken heart,.put it right over Brad.Yeah.(imitates heartbeat).pounding away.Alright, thanks for

vgW6ZD_QwwQ,How should you do kick-out exercise for leg edema or swelling?,"(290, 323)", Then we do kick outs.There you go yep.Excellent.Brad youre a good student. Well Ive been practicing Bob. Yeah. I really would like to say.you can certainly use pillows.but if youre gonna be doing this for any length of time.this leg wedgers not that expensive.and its much more comfortable and they work better.than a pillow for sure. You wanna make sure thats linked down below.that they know where to get that.because this is a handy thing.that you could even fall asleep on if you have edema.And that would help matters.Next one just do some ankle pumps,"(intro music).Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, a physical therapist.I can say it.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.Because we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion of course, Bob.Now what threw me off, Brad,.is I'm on the right side here,.I'm not used to being over here.It even throws my language off.Well don't worry about it, Bob,.you have to get used to it.Today, Top Seven Exercises for Leg Edema, or Swelling.This is a program or protocol that we actually use.for patients that, when they have leg edema,.and they're going home,.these are the exercises they can do.You can do them in bed, or you can do them seated.We're gonna show you both ways.It's actually better to do them in bed.Gravity's working with you.Gravity's working with you, right.But before we do that, if you're new to our channel,.please take a second to subscribe to us.We provide videos on staying healthy, fit, pain free,.and we upload every day.Brad's really gonna be the lazy man on this video.That's right.But you can also join us,.we're always giving away something.We don't know what we're giving away right now, do we?.No, we're giving away something, though.If you join us, go to our Facebook page,.it's pinned to the top of our page.If you go to BobandBradcom,.it's under our section Giveaways.Don't miss out on it.All we need is your name and email.Oh you wanna do it, huh?.I wanna get rid of it, Bob, I've got a place for it.Alright, good for you.Alright, so with edema, or swelling.What often is gravity is pulling fluid from everywhere.in your body, and it often settles.in your calf, and ankles, and feet.So we wanna get, the thing is,.if you wanna get rid of fluid,.it's not gonna go out your toes.It's gotta go back up into your truck,.where it gets processed, and then it gets expelled.from the body.In other words, you urinate, or pee, it out.Right.To be graphic.We gotta get the fluid back up into this area,.so that's why it works really well.if you can take a leg wedge,.we often recommend this for back pain, too.Or if you just take some pillows and put them.underneath your feet,.and get your feet up higher.than your heart if possible.That's doing a pretty good job.But also, you can do these in a seated position.They're still gonna help.They just won't be quite as effective.Sure.So we got the Seven Exercises, let's get started, Brad.Before we do,.quite often you wanna do a little bit.of deep diaphragmatic breathing,.which kind of clears the area here.If you know how to do diaphragmatic breathing,.or as a review,.when you breath in, your abdomen is actually expanding,.and that opens up the diaphragm.So when Brad breaths in, you can see how it's expanding.When he breaths out, it actually goes down.That's the opposite of what people quite often think.A lot of times they think,.When I breath in my chest should go up,.and it's actually, you want your diaphragm to go out.So five quick breaths,.and then we go on and start the exercises.So the first one,.just to get a little movement in the abdomen here,.we're actually just gonna do flexing forward here,.for five times.I'm sorry, these are all 10-15 times, actually,.let's stick with 15 times.Okay.Yep.So you're just gonna come forward a little bit here.Very easy to do.15 times.We'll say we're up to 15, alright?.Sure.So people can follow along.Number two, you're actually gonna rotate the trunk.using your hips.Brad's gonna go ahead and do that.He's gonna use the hips,.I'm actually gonna rotate like this, in the chair,.going back and forth.You're gonna put your hands together like this.Again the idea is you're going.Well why am I,.I'm trying to get fluid out of my legs,.why am I working on my trunk?.You've gotta clear the drain, basically.Right.If the drain is plugged,.the fluid is not gonna be able.to go up into the body and be processed.One metaphor, or whatever,.that I heard from Aaron, who's certified,.he said imagine your bellybutton is the drain,.and that's where the fluid has to get up to.So we wanna clear the area here first,.so it's not like a dam preventing that fluid.from your legs and ankles to come up this way.We're starting here and working down that way.I've definitely seen that on patients.where there was a dam.Actually once we cleared it up here,.the fluid started to go down.Alright next one, Brad, is butt squeezes.On this one you're not gonna be able to see me do it really,.but I'm just squeezing my butt together.Again, you wanna hold it for like three seconds,.and we're gonna go up to 15.Okay next one,.marching in place.So Brad, he's just doing hip flexion, unilaterally,.going back and forth.Good, 15 times, you got it, number?.Oh yeah, we're good.Then we do kick outs.There you go, yep.Excellent.Brad, you're a good student.Well, I've been practicing, Bob.Yeah.I really would like to say,.you can certainly use pillows,.but if you're gonna be doing this for any length of time,.this leg wedger's not that expensive,.and it's much more comfortable, and they work better.than a pillow, for sure.You wanna make sure that's linked down below,.that they know where to get that,.because this is a handy thing.that you could even fall asleep on if you have edema.And that would help matters.Next one, just do some ankle pumps.I'm doing alternating, Brad's doing,.well you were.Either way.Well, I like doing alternating,.but I can do it think way, too.This is one you can do throughout the day,.even when you're standing,.you can do some ankle pumps like this.And the final one is just wiggle your toes.Yep.Just start wiggling the toes.This little piggy went to the market, right Brad?.Oh, Bob, why Bob?.Why?.This little piggy said.Why Bob, why Bob, all the way home.But you can clearly see, we started with these,.and we worked the muscles here,.and we just went down the way.To be honest, Brad, what you should do.is you wanna go that way,.and the next time, if you wanna do a full thing,.you go down and then come back again.Or the next time, start at the toes, and then go all up.Okay.So, just to mix it up a little bit,.and get the fluid moving, so.Good luck with your edema.Hopefully we're gonna get that resolved.Remember, Brad and I can fix just about anything.Except for.A broken heart,.put it right over Brad.Yeah.(imitates heartbeat).pounding away.Alright, thanks for watching","{'(66.24, 67.83)': 'please take a second to subscribe to us', '(155.634, 156.46699999999998)':  'Right', '(27.45, 28.53)':  'Sure', '(57.99,

vgW6ZD_QwwQ,How one can do ankle pumps that help in reducing leg swelling?,"(327, 345)", Im doing alternating Brads doing.well you were.Either way. Well I like doing alternating.but I can do it think way too. This is one you can do throughout the day.even when youre standing.you can do some ankle pumps like this.And the final one is just wiggle your toes. Yep. Just start wiggling the toes.This little piggy went to the market right Brad,"(intro music).Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, a physical therapist.I can say it.Brad Heineck, physical therapist.Because we are the most famous physical therapists.on the internet.In our opinion of course, Bob.Now what threw me off, Brad,.is I'm on the right side here,.I'm not used to being over here.It even throws my language off.Well don't worry about it, Bob,.you have to get used to it.Today, Top Seven Exercises for Leg Edema, or Swelling.This is a program or protocol that we actually use.for patients that, when they have leg edema,.and they're going home,.these are the exercises they can do.You can do them in bed, or you can do them seated.We're gonna show you both ways.It's actually better to do them in bed.Gravity's working with you.Gravity's working with you, right.But before we do that, if you're new to our channel,.please take a second to subscribe to us.We provide videos on staying healthy, fit, pain free,.and we upload every day.Brad's really gonna be the lazy man on this video.That's right.But you can also join us,.we're always giving away something.We don't know what we're giving away right now, do we?.No, we're giving away something, though.If you join us, go to our Facebook page,.it's pinned to the top of our page.If you go to BobandBradcom,.it's under our section Giveaways.Don't miss out on it.All we need is your name and email.Oh you wanna do it, huh?.I wanna get rid of it, Bob, I've got a place for it.Alright, good for you.Alright, so with edema, or swelling.What often is gravity is pulling fluid from everywhere.in your body, and it often settles.in your calf, and ankles, and feet.So we wanna get, the thing is,.if you wanna get rid of fluid,.it's not gonna go out your toes.It's gotta go back up into your truck,.where it gets processed, and then it gets expelled.from the body.In other words, you urinate, or pee, it out.Right.To be graphic.We gotta get the fluid back up into this area,.so that's why it works really well.if you can take a leg wedge,.we often recommend this for back pain, too.Or if you just take some pillows and put them.underneath your feet,.and get your feet up higher.than your heart if possible.That's doing a pretty good job.But also, you can do these in a seated position.They're still gonna help.They just won't be quite as effective.Sure.So we got the Seven Exercises, let's get started, Brad.Before we do,.quite often you wanna do a little bit.of deep diaphragmatic breathing,.which kind of clears the area here.If you know how to do diaphragmatic breathing,.or as a review,.when you breath in, your abdomen is actually expanding,.and that opens up the diaphragm.So when Brad breaths in, you can see how it's expanding.When he breaths out, it actually goes down.That's the opposite of what people quite often think.A lot of times they think,.When I breath in my chest should go up,.and it's actually, you want your diaphragm to go out.So five quick breaths,.and then we go on and start the exercises.So the first one,.just to get a little movement in the abdomen here,.we're actually just gonna do flexing forward here,.for five times.I'm sorry, these are all 10-15 times, actually,.let's stick with 15 times.Okay.Yep.So you're just gonna come forward a little bit here.Very easy to do.15 times.We'll say we're up to 15, alright?.Sure.So people can follow along.Number two, you're actually gonna rotate the trunk.using your hips.Brad's gonna go ahead and do that.He's gonna use the hips,.I'm actually gonna rotate like this, in the chair,.going back and forth.You're gonna put your hands together like this.Again the idea is you're going.Well why am I,.I'm trying to get fluid out of my legs,.why am I working on my trunk?.You've gotta clear the drain, basically.Right.If the drain is plugged,.the fluid is not gonna be able.to go up into the body and be processed.One metaphor, or whatever,.that I heard from Aaron, who's certified,.he said imagine your bellybutton is the drain,.and that's where the fluid has to get up to.So we wanna clear the area here first,.so it's not like a dam preventing that fluid.from your legs and ankles to come up this way.We're starting here and working down that way.I've definitely seen that on patients.where there was a dam.Actually once we cleared it up here,.the fluid started to go down.Alright next one, Brad, is butt squeezes.On this one you're not gonna be able to see me do it really,.but I'm just squeezing my butt together.Again, you wanna hold it for like three seconds,.and we're gonna go up to 15.Okay next one,.marching in place.So Brad, he's just doing hip flexion, unilaterally,.going back and forth.Good, 15 times, you got it, number?.Oh yeah, we're good.Then we do kick outs.There you go, yep.Excellent.Brad, you're a good student.Well, I've been practicing, Bob.Yeah.I really would like to say,.you can certainly use pillows,.but if you're gonna be doing this for any length of time,.this leg wedger's not that expensive,.and it's much more comfortable, and they work better.than a pillow, for sure.You wanna make sure that's linked down below,.that they know where to get that,.because this is a handy thing.that you could even fall asleep on if you have edema.And that would help matters.Next one, just do some ankle pumps.I'm doing alternating, Brad's doing,.well you were.Either way.Well, I like doing alternating,.but I can do it think way, too.This is one you can do throughout the day,.even when you're standing,.you can do some ankle pumps like this.And the final one is just wiggle your toes.Yep.Just start wiggling the toes.This little piggy went to the market, right Brad?.Oh, Bob, why Bob?.Why?.This little piggy said.Why Bob, why Bob, all the way home.But you can clearly see, we started with these,.and we worked the muscles here,.and we just went down the way.To be honest, Brad, what you should do.is you wanna go that way,.and the next time, if you wanna do a full thing,.you go down and then come back again.Or the next time, start at the toes, and then go all up.Okay.So, just to mix it up a little bit,.and get the fluid moving, so.Good luck with your edema.Hopefully we're gonna get that resolved.Remember, Brad and I can fix just about anything.Except for.A broken heart,.put it right over Brad.Yeah.(imitates heartbeat).pounding away.Alright, thanks for watching","{'(66.24, 67.83)': 'please take a second to subscribe to us', '(155.634, 156.46699999999998)':  'Right', '(27.45, 28.53)':

to.five seconds and then were gonna come.right back down keep in mind the higher.you go the more chance that it has to be.irritating to your lower back go up as.high as you can painfree try to keep.this in as painfree range as you can i.like to tell people were going to shoot.for about 10 to 20 repetitions and then.were going to repeat that three times.exercise number two is one of my.favorite stabilization exercises for.your lower back this is going to be a,what's up guys jared beckstrand here.doctor of physical therapy tone and.titan and in this video i want to share.with you five of the best core.strengthening exercises for your sciatic.nerve pain what is sciatica well it's.pain or numbness or teeny week that runs.down the back of your leg most of the.time caused by some problem up here in.your lower back if we can teach you the.right strengthening and stabilization.exercises to help minimize some of that.problem you're going to feel a lot.better that is my goal with this video.in fact in an effort to serve you even.better this is part two of a two-part.video series of home exercises that you.can do for your sciatic nerve pain in.video one i showed you the best.stretches and mobilization techniques to.help to eliminate your pain and help.your sciatic symptoms to feel better in.this video what we need to follow that.up with is the right core strengthening.and lumbar stabilization techniques in.order to keep your sciatic nerve.symptoms away that's exactly what i hope.to share with you in this video if.you're interested in checking out part.one check out the link in the.description down below i will also link.it at the end of this video and i hope.that helps you out that being said grab.some space on the floor first exercise.is coming your way now.one of the best ways to strengthen your.lower back muscles is to actually train.them with your hips one of my favorite.ways to do that at home is with some.bridges let's go ahead and get started.lay down on your back with both of your.knees bent what i'm going to do now is.contract your glutes squeeze your butt.together and then use that contraction.to lift your hips up off the floor again.the emphasis is right here in the butt.muscles in those glute muscles we're.going to hold this for about three to.five seconds and then we're gonna come.right back down keep in mind the higher.you go the more chance that it has to be.irritating to your lower back go up as.high as you can pain-free try to keep.this in as pain-free range as you can i.like to tell people we're going to shoot.for about 10 to 20 repetitions and then.we're going to repeat that three times.exercise number two is one of my.favorite stabilization exercises for.your lower back this is going to be a.verb dog we're going to come right down.here on all fours and then in this.position so i've got my hands under my.shoulders my knees are under my hips.i'm going to extend my right arm.straight in front of me as my left leg.goes straight back and then we're going.to return to the starting position and.then repeat that over here on the other.side the primary problem that i.encounter with this is people will want.to roll their hips they lose the.stability in their back so as i come.here you see how my hip opened up.towards you opened up towards the camera.try not to let that happen we're going.to bring the hip down so that the hips.stay parallel to the floor throughout.that whole exercise again about 10 to 20.reps per side and then we're going to.repeat that three times.one great way to improve stability in.your lower back is to improve lateral.stability in your core we're talking.about the oblique muscles and the lumbar.pair spinals the quadratus lumborum my.favorite way to do that is with some.side points so.i like to start with a modified side.plank you're going to be on your right.elbow my right elbow is underneath my.right shoulder my right knee is bent my.left leg is out straight i'm then going.to kick on these lateral hip muscles and.lateral pore muscles to lift my hips up.towards the ceiling.as i'm up in this modified modified.plank position i'm on my right elbow and.the outside of my right knee i should.have a straight line nose belly button.down between my knees i'd hold that for.about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that.three times on each side if that's too.easy what we can do is get into a full.side plank i just extended my right leg.out now as i get up into this position.i'm once again on my right elbow but now.i'm on the outside of my right foot.instead of on the outside of my right.knee that's what a full plank looks like.a full side plank once again should be a.straight line nose belly button between.my knees down between my ankles now.we're really trying to engage these core.muscles you can actually draw your belly.button in while you're holding this.exercise just a great exercise for.lateral stability you're going to hold.this for 20 to 30 seconds and then.you're going to repeat that three times.on each side.next let's do a little more focus work.on that lower back specifically this is.going to be well in pilates it's called.a swimmer so we call these swimmers.that's what i refer to in my clinic.you're going to lay down on your stomach.with your legs.legs out straight your arms extended.above you right here.similar to a bird dog i'm going to lift.my right arm up off of the floor at the.same time i lift my left leg off of the.floor and then return to the starting.position and then repeat left arm right.leg and so these swimmers looks just.like this just another great way that we.can stabilize that lower back there's.not really much movement occurring it's.a very safe position for your spine to.be in but we're working all of the.muscles that are going to stabilize your.back as we're doing these swimmers.looks just like this we're going to.repeat this once again about 10 to 20.repetitions on each side and then we're.going to repeat that three times.usually what i'll tell people is we'll.use the swimmers as a way to get to the.next exercise a lot of times this is a.little more aggressive but it's my.personal favorite way to strengthen the.entire spine last exercise that i want.to demonstrate for you today is a.superman exercise you're going to be.down here on your stomach once again.arms

straight back and then were going.to return to the starting position and.then repeat that over here on the other.side the primary problem that i.encounter with this is people will want.to roll their hips they lose the.stability in their back so as i come.here you see how my hip opened up.towards you opened up towards the camera.try not to let that happen were going.to bring the hip down so that the hips.stay parallel to the floor throughout.that whole exercise again about 10 to 20.reps per side and then were going to.repeat that three times.one great way to improve stability in,what's up guys jared beckstrand here.doctor of physical therapy tone and.titan and in this video i want to share.with you five of the best core.strengthening exercises for your sciatic.nerve pain what is sciatica well it's.pain or numbness or teeny week that runs.down the back of your leg most of the.time caused by some problem up here in.your lower back if we can teach you the.right strengthening and stabilization.exercises to help minimize some of that.problem you're going to feel a lot.better that is my goal with this video.in fact in an effort to serve you even.better this is part two of a two-part.video series of home exercises that you.can do for your sciatic nerve pain in.video one i showed you the best.stretches and mobilization techniques to.help to eliminate your pain and help.your sciatic symptoms to feel better in.this video what we need to follow that.up with is the right core strengthening.and lumbar stabilization techniques in.order to keep your sciatic nerve.symptoms away that's exactly what i hope.to share with you in this video if.you're interested in checking out part.one check out the link in the.description down below i will also link.it at the end of this video and i hope.that helps you out that being said grab.some space on the floor first exercise.is coming your way now.one of the best ways to strengthen your.lower back muscles is to actually train.them with your hips one of my favorite.ways to do that at home is with some.bridges let's go ahead and get started.lay down on your back with both of your.knees bent what i'm going to do now is.contract your glutes squeeze your butt.together and then use that contraction.to lift your hips up off the floor again.the emphasis is right here in the butt.muscles in those glute muscles we're.going to hold this for about three to.five seconds and then we're gonna come.right back down keep in mind the higher.you go the more chance that it has to be.irritating to your lower back go up as.high as you can pain-free try to keep.this in as pain-free range as you can i.like to tell people we're going to shoot.for about 10 to 20 repetitions and then.we're going to repeat that three times.exercise number two is one of my.favorite stabilization exercises for.your lower back this is going to be a.verb dog we're going to come right down.here on all fours and then in this.position so i've got my hands under my.shoulders my knees are under my hips.i'm going to extend my right arm.straight in front of me as my left leg.goes straight back and then we're going.to return to the starting position and.then repeat that over here on the other.side the primary problem that i.encounter with this is people will want.to roll their hips they lose the.stability in their back so as i come.here you see how my hip opened up.towards you opened up towards the camera.try not to let that happen we're going.to bring the hip down so that the hips.stay parallel to the floor throughout.that whole exercise again about 10 to 20.reps per side and then we're going to.repeat that three times.one great way to improve stability in.your lower back is to improve lateral.stability in your core we're talking.about the oblique muscles and the lumbar.pair spinals the quadratus lumborum my.favorite way to do that is with some.side points so.i like to start with a modified side.plank you're going to be on your right.elbow my right elbow is underneath my.right shoulder my right knee is bent my.left leg is out straight i'm then going.to kick on these lateral hip muscles and.lateral pore muscles to lift my hips up.towards the ceiling.as i'm up in this modified modified.plank position i'm on my right elbow and.the outside of my right knee i should.have a straight line nose belly button.down between my knees i'd hold that for.about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that.three times on each side if that's too.easy what we can do is get into a full.side plank i just extended my right leg.out now as i get up into this position.i'm once again on my right elbow but now.i'm on the outside of my right foot.instead of on the outside of my right.knee that's what a full plank looks like.a full side plank once again should be a.straight line nose belly button between.my knees down between my ankles now.we're really trying to engage these core.muscles you can actually draw your belly.button in while you're holding this.exercise just a great exercise for.lateral stability you're going to hold.this for 20 to 30 seconds and then.you're going to repeat that three times.on each side.next let's do a little more focus work.on that lower back specifically this is.going to be well in pilates it's called.a swimmer so we call these swimmers.that's what i refer to in my clinic.you're going to lay down on your stomach.with your legs.legs out straight your arms extended.above you right here.similar to a bird dog i'm going to lift.my right arm up off of the floor at the.same time i lift my left leg off of the.floor and then return to the starting.position and then repeat left arm right.leg and so these swimmers looks just.like this just another great way that we.can stabilize that lower back there's.not really much movement occurring it's.a very safe position for your spine to.be in but we're working all of the.muscles that are going to stabilize your.back as we're doing these swimmers.looks just like this we're going to.repeat this once again about 10 to 20.repetitions on each side and then we're.going to repeat that three times.usually what i'll tell people is we'll.use the swimmers as a way to get to the.next exercise a lot of times this is a.little more aggressive but it's my.personal favorite way to strengthen the.entire spine last exercise that i want.to demonstrate for you today is a.superman exercise you're going to be.down here on your stomach once again.arms extended over your head now what.we're going to do lift our arms and.chest

CWRWeoaqi8k,How to do a kind of side planks exercise that kicks on lateral hip muscles?,"(191, 220)",i like to start with a modified side.plank youre going to be on your right.elbow my right elbow is underneath my.right shoulder my right knee is bent my.left leg is out straight im then going.to kick on these lateral hip muscles and.lateral pore muscles to lift my hips up.towards the ceiling.as im up in this modified modified.plank position im on my right elbow and.the outside of my right knee i should.have a straight line nose belly button.down between my knees id hold that for.about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that.three times on each side if thats too,what's up guys jared beckstrand here.doctor of physical therapy tone and.titan and in this video i want to share.with you five of the best core.strengthening exercises for your sciatic.nerve pain what is sciatica well it's.pain or numbness or teeny week that runs.down the back of your leg most of the.time caused by some problem up here in.your lower back if we can teach you the.right strengthening and stabilization.exercises to help minimize some of that.problem you're going to feel a lot.better that is my goal with this video.in fact in an effort to serve you even.better this is part two of a two-part.video series of home exercises that you.can do for your sciatic nerve pain in.video one i showed you the best.stretches and mobilization techniques to.help to eliminate your pain and help.your sciatic symptoms to feel better in.this video what we need to follow that.up with is the right core strengthening.and lumbar stabilization techniques in.order to keep your sciatic nerve.symptoms away that's exactly what i hope.to share with you in this video if.you're interested in checking out part.one check out the link in the.description down below i will also link.it at the end of this video and i hope.that helps you out that being said grab.some space on the floor first exercise.is coming your way now.one of the best ways to strengthen your.lower back muscles is to actually train.them with your hips one of my favorite.ways to do that at home is with some.bridges let's go ahead and get started.lay down on your back with both of your.knees bent what i'm going to do now is.contract your glutes squeeze your butt.together and then use that contraction.to lift your hips up off the floor again.the emphasis is right here in the butt.muscles in those glute muscles we're.going to hold this for about three to.five seconds and then we're gonna come.right back down keep in mind the higher.you go the more chance that it has to be.irritating to your lower back go up as.high as you can pain-free try to keep.this in as pain-free range as you can i.like to tell people we're going to shoot.for about 10 to 20 repetitions and then.we're going to repeat that three times.exercise number two is one of my.favorite stabilization exercises for.your lower back this is going to be a.verb dog we're going to come right down.here on all fours and then in this.position so i've got my hands under my.shoulders my knees are under my hips.i'm going to extend my right arm.straight in front of me as my left leg.goes straight back and then we're going.to return to the starting position and.then repeat that over here on the other.side the primary problem that i.encounter with this is people will want.to roll their hips they lose the.stability in their back so as i come.here you see how my hip opened up.towards you opened up towards the camera.try not to let that happen we're going.to bring the hip down so that the hips.stay parallel to the floor throughout.that whole exercise again about 10 to 20.reps per side and then we're going to.repeat that three times.one great way to improve stability in.your lower back is to improve lateral.stability in your core we're talking.about the oblique muscles and the lumbar.pair spinals the quadratus lumborum my.favorite way to do that is with some.side points so.i like to start with a modified side.plank you're going to be on your right.elbow my right elbow is underneath my.right shoulder my right knee is bent my.left leg is out straight i'm then going.to kick on these lateral hip muscles and.lateral pore muscles to lift my hips up.towards the ceiling.as i'm up in this modified modified.plank position i'm on my right elbow and.the outside of my right knee i should.have a straight line nose belly button.down between my knees i'd hold that for.about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that.three times on each side if that's too.easy what we can do is get into a full.side plank i just extended my right leg.out now as i get up into this position.i'm once again on my right elbow but now.i'm on the outside of my right foot.instead of on the outside of my right.knee that's what a full plank looks like.a full side plank once again should be a.straight line nose belly button between.my knees down between my ankles now.we're really trying to engage these core.muscles you can actually draw your belly.button in while you're holding this.exercise just a great exercise for.lateral stability you're going to hold.this for 20 to 30 seconds and then.you're going to repeat that three times.on each side.next let's do a little more focus work.on that lower back specifically this is.going to be well in pilates it's called.a swimmer so we call these swimmers.that's what i refer to in my clinic.you're going to lay down on your stomach.with your legs.legs out straight your arms extended.above you right here.similar to a bird dog i'm going to lift.my right arm up off of the floor at the.same time i lift my left leg off of the.floor and then return to the starting.position and then repeat left arm right.leg and so these swimmers looks just.like this just another great way that we.can stabilize that lower back there's.not really much movement occurring it's.a very safe position for your spine to.be in but we're working all of the.muscles that are going to stabilize your.back as we're doing these swimmers.looks just like this we're going to.repeat this once again about 10 to 20.repetitions on each side and then we're.going to repeat that three times.usually what i'll tell people is we'll.use the swimmers as a way to get to the.next exercise a lot of times this is a.little more aggressive but it's my.personal favorite way to strengthen the.entire spine last exercise that i want.to demonstrate for you today is a.superman exercise you're going to be.down here on your stomach once again.arms extended over your head now what.we're going to do lift our arms and.chest up off of the floor but then i.also want you to try to lift your legs.up off of the floor i want your knees to.get up off the ground so this is what it.looks like right here chest and knees.come up off of the floor and then return.back down to that starting position and.so that's what that full superman looks.like we've got a lot more motion going.at the lower back so this does have.potential to be a little more.aggravating but if you've worked up to.this and if you've done it the right way.this should be a very good exercise to.minimize some of those sciatic nerve.symptoms and those that sciatic nerve.pain about three sets of ten is what i.typically recommend for people on those.superman exercises as far as your.frequency with these i want you to just.do these exercises once a day you don't.need to necessarily do it more than that.but consistency is key so make sure you.come back regularly watch this video.give the cues that you need and perform.the exercises the right way so that you.can see improvement of course if you're.interested in checking out that first.video those stretches and mobilizations.to help your sciatic

CWRWeoaqi8k,How to do a side planks exercise that kicks on lateral hip muscles?,"(224, 268)",easy what we can do is get into a full.side plank i just extended my right leg.out now as i get up into this position.im once again on my right elbow but now.im on the outside of my right foot.instead of on the outside of my right.knee thats what a full plank looks like.a full side plank once again should be a.straight line nose belly button between.my knees down between my ankles now.were really trying to engage these core.muscles you can actually draw your belly.button in while youre holding this.exercise just a great exercise for.lateral stability youre going to hold.this for 20 to 30 seconds and then.youre going to repeat that three times.on each side.next lets do a little more focus work.on that lower back specifically this is.going to be well in pilates its called.a swimmer so we call these swimmers,what's up guys jared beckstrand here.doctor of physical therapy tone and.titan and in this video i want to share.with you five of the best core.strengthening exercises for your sciatic.nerve pain what is sciatica well it's.pain or numbness or teeny week that runs.down the back of your leg most of the.time caused by some problem up here in.your lower back if we can teach you the.right strengthening and stabilization.exercises to help minimize some of that.problem you're going to feel a lot.better that is my goal with this video.in fact in an effort to serve you even.better this is part two of a two-part.video series of home exercises that you.can do for your sciatic nerve pain in.video one i showed you the best.stretches and mobilization techniques to.help to eliminate your pain and help.your sciatic symptoms to feel better in.this video what we need to follow that.up with is the right core strengthening.and lumbar stabilization techniques in.order to keep your sciatic nerve.symptoms away that's exactly what i hope.to share with you in this video if.you're interested in checking out part.one check out the link in the.description down below i will also link.it at the end of this video and i hope.that helps you out that being said grab.some space on the floor first exercise.is coming your way now.one of the best ways to strengthen your.lower back muscles is to actually train.them with your hips one of my favorite.ways to do that at home is with some.bridges let's go ahead and get started.lay down on your back with both of your.knees bent what i'm going to do now is.contract your glutes squeeze your butt.together and then use that contraction.to lift your hips up off the floor again.the emphasis is right here in the butt.muscles in those glute muscles we're.going to hold this for about three to.five seconds and then we're gonna come.right back down keep in mind the higher.you go the more chance that it has to be.irritating to your lower back go up as.high as you can pain-free try to keep.this in as pain-free range as you can i.like to tell people we're going to shoot.for about 10 to 20 repetitions and then.we're going to repeat that three times.exercise number two is one of my.favorite stabilization exercises for.your lower back this is going to be a.verb dog we're going to come right down.here on all fours and then in this.position so i've got my hands under my.shoulders my knees are under my hips.i'm going to extend my right arm.straight in front of me as my left leg.goes straight back and then we're going.to return to the starting position and.then repeat that over here on the other.side the primary problem that i.encounter with this is people will want.to roll their hips they lose the.stability in their back so as i come.here you see how my hip opened up.towards you opened up towards the camera.try not to let that happen we're going.to bring the hip down so that the hips.stay parallel to the floor throughout.that whole exercise again about 10 to 20.reps per side and then we're going to.repeat that three times.one great way to improve stability in.your lower back is to improve lateral.stability in your core we're talking.about the oblique muscles and the lumbar.pair spinals the quadratus lumborum my.favorite way to do that is with some.side points so.i like to start with a modified side.plank you're going to be on your right.elbow my right elbow is underneath my.right shoulder my right knee is bent my.left leg is out straight i'm then going.to kick on these lateral hip muscles and.lateral pore muscles to lift my hips up.towards the ceiling.as i'm up in this modified modified.plank position i'm on my right elbow and.the outside of my right knee i should.have a straight line nose belly button.down between my knees i'd hold that for.about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that.three times on each side if that's too.easy what we can do is get into a full.side plank i just extended my right leg.out now as i get up into this position.i'm once again on my right elbow but now.i'm on the outside of my right foot.instead of on the outside of my right.knee that's what a full plank looks like.a full side plank once again should be a.straight line nose belly button between.my knees down between my ankles now.we're really trying to engage these core.muscles you can actually draw your belly.button in while you're holding this.exercise just a great exercise for.lateral stability you're going to hold.this for 20 to 30 seconds and then.you're going to repeat that three times.on each side.next let's do a little more focus work.on that lower back specifically this is.going to be well in pilates it's called.a swimmer so we call these swimmers.that's what i refer to in my clinic.you're going to lay down on your stomach.with your legs.legs out straight your arms extended.above you right here.similar to a bird dog i'm going to lift.my right arm up off of the floor at the.same time i lift my left leg off of the.floor and then return to the starting.position and then repeat left arm right.leg and so these swimmers looks just.like this just another great way that we.can stabilize that lower back there's.not really much movement occurring it's.a very safe position for your spine to.be in but we're working all of the.muscles that are going to stabilize your.back as we're doing these swimmers.looks just like this we're going to.repeat this once again about 10 to 20.repetitions on each side and then we're.going to repeat that three times.usually what i'll tell people is we'll.use the swimmers as a way to get to the.next exercise a lot of times this is a.little more aggressive but it's my.personal favorite way to strengthen the.entire spine last exercise that i want.to demonstrate for you today is a.superman exercise you're going to be.down here on your stomach once again.arms extended over your head now what.we're going to do lift our arms and.chest up off of the floor but then i.also want you to try to lift your legs.up off of the floor i want your knees to.get up off the ground so this is what it.looks like right here chest and knees.come up off of the floor and then return.back down to that starting position and.so that's what that full superman looks.like we've got a lot more motion going.at the lower back so this does have.potential to be a little more.aggravating but if you've worked up to.this and if you've done it the right way.this should be a very good exercise to.minimize some of those sciatic nerve.symptoms and those that sciatic nerve.pain about three sets of ten is what i.typically recommend for people on those.superman exercises as far as your.frequency with these i want you to just.do these exercises once a day you don't.need to necessarily do it more than that.but consistency is key so make sure you.come back regularly watch this video.give the cues that you need and perform.the exercises the right way so that you.can see improvement of course if you're.interested in checking out that first.video those stretches and mobilizations.to help your sciatic nerve feel better.check it out i've got it linked right.here this is another one that

CWRWeoaqi8k,How one can do swimmer exercise that helps in strengthening the spine?,"(270, 334)",a swimmer so we call these swimmers.thats what i refer to in my clinic.youre going to lay down on your stomach.with your legs.legs out straight your arms extended.above you right here.similar to a bird dog im going to lift.my right arm up off of the floor at the.same time i lift my left leg off of the.floor and then return to the starting.position and then repeat left arm right.leg and so these swimmers looks just.like this just another great way that we.can stabilize that lower back theres.not really much movement occurring its.a very safe position for your spine to.be in but were working all of the.muscles that are going to stabilize your.back as were doing these swimmers.looks just like this were going to.repeat this once again about 10 to 20.repetitions on each side and then were.going to repeat that three times.usually what ill tell people is well.use the swimmers as a way to get to the.next exercise a lot of times this is a.little more aggressive but its my.personal favorite way to strengthen the.entire spine last exercise that i want,what's up guys jared beckstrand here.doctor of physical therapy tone and.titan and in this video i want to share.with you five of the best core.strengthening exercises for your sciatic.nerve pain what is sciatica well it's.pain or numbness or teeny week that runs.down the back of your leg most of the.time caused by some problem up here in.your lower back if we can teach you the.right strengthening and stabilization.exercises to help minimize some of that.problem you're going to feel a lot.better that is my goal with this video.in fact in an effort to serve you even.better this is part two of a two-part.video series of home exercises that you.can do for your sciatic nerve pain in.video one i showed you the best.stretches and mobilization techniques to.help to eliminate your pain and help.your sciatic symptoms to feel better in.this video what we need to follow that.up with is the right core strengthening.and lumbar stabilization techniques in.order to keep your sciatic nerve.symptoms away that's exactly what i hope.to share with you in this video if.you're interested in checking out part.one check out the link in the.description down below i will also link.it at the end of this video and i hope.that helps you out that being said grab.some space on the floor first exercise.is coming your way now.one of the best ways to strengthen your.lower back muscles is to actually train.them with your hips one of my favorite.ways to do that at home is with some.bridges let's go ahead and get started.lay down on your back with both of your.knees bent what i'm going to do now is.contract your glutes squeeze your butt.together and then use that contraction.to lift your hips up off the floor again.the emphasis is right here in the butt.muscles in those glute muscles we're.going to hold this for about three to.five seconds and then we're gonna come.right back down keep in mind the higher.you go the more chance that it has to be.irritating to your lower back go up as.high as you can pain-free try to keep.this in as pain-free range as you can i.like to tell people we're going to shoot.for about 10 to 20 repetitions and then.we're going to repeat that three times.exercise number two is one of my.favorite stabilization exercises for.your lower back this is going to be a.verb dog we're going to come right down.here on all fours and then in this.position so i've got my hands under my.shoulders my knees are under my hips.i'm going to extend my right arm.straight in front of me as my left leg.goes straight back and then we're going.to return to the starting position and.then repeat that over here on the other.side the primary problem that i.encounter with this is people will want.to roll their hips they lose the.stability in their back so as i come.here you see how my hip opened up.towards you opened up towards the camera.try not to let that happen we're going.to bring the hip down so that the hips.stay parallel to the floor throughout.that whole exercise again about 10 to 20.reps per side and then we're going to.repeat that three times.one great way to improve stability in.your lower back is to improve lateral.stability in your core we're talking.about the oblique muscles and the lumbar.pair spinals the quadratus lumborum my.favorite way to do that is with some.side points so.i like to start with a modified side.plank you're going to be on your right.elbow my right elbow is underneath my.right shoulder my right knee is bent my.left leg is out straight i'm then going.to kick on these lateral hip muscles and.lateral pore muscles to lift my hips up.towards the ceiling.as i'm up in this modified modified.plank position i'm on my right elbow and.the outside of my right knee i should.have a straight line nose belly button.down between my knees i'd hold that for.about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that.three times on each side if that's too.easy what we can do is get into a full.side plank i just extended my right leg.out now as i get up into this position.i'm once again on my right elbow but now.i'm on the outside of my right foot.instead of on the outside of my right.knee that's what a full plank looks like.a full side plank once again should be a.straight line nose belly button between.my knees down between my ankles now.we're really trying to engage these core.muscles you can actually draw your belly.button in while you're holding this.exercise just a great exercise for.lateral stability you're going to hold.this for 20 to 30 seconds and then.you're going to repeat that three times.on each side.next let's do a little more focus work.on that lower back specifically this is.going to be well in pilates it's called.a swimmer so we call these swimmers.that's what i refer to in my clinic.you're going to lay down on your stomach.with your legs.legs out straight your arms extended.above you right here.similar to a bird dog i'm going to lift.my right arm up off of the floor at the.same time i lift my left leg off of the.floor and then return to the starting.position and then repeat left arm right.leg and so these swimmers looks just.like this just another great way that we.can stabilize that lower back there's.not really much movement occurring it's.a very safe position for your spine to.be in but we're working all of the.muscles that are going to stabilize your.back as we're doing these swimmers.looks just like this we're going to.repeat this once again about 10 to 20.repetitions on each side and then we're.going to repeat that three times.usually what i'll tell people is we'll.use the swimmers as a way to get to the.next exercise a lot of times this is a.little more aggressive but it's my.personal favorite way to strengthen the.entire spine last exercise that i want.to demonstrate for you today is a.superman exercise you're going to be.down here on your stomach once again.arms extended over your head now what.we're going to do lift our arms and.chest up off of the floor but then i.also want you to try to lift your legs.up off of the floor i want your knees to.get up off the ground so this is what it.looks like right here chest and knees.come up off of the floor and then return.back down to that starting position and.so that's what that full superman looks.like we've got a lot more motion going.at the lower back so this does have.potential to be a little more.aggravating but if you've worked up to.this and if you've done it the right way.this should be a very good exercise to.minimize some of those sciatic nerve.symptoms and those that sciatic nerve.pain about three sets of ten is what i.typically recommend for people on those.superman exercises as far as your.frequency with these i want you to just.do these exercises once a day you don't.need to necessarily do it more than that.but consistency is key so make sure you.come back regularly watch this video.give the cues that you need and perform.the exercises the right way so that you.can see improvement of course if you're.interested in checking out that first.video those stretches and mobilizations.to help your sciatic nerve feel better.check it out i've got it linked

CWRWeoaqi8k,How one can do supermans exercise that minimizes sciatic nerve pain?,"(339, 386)",to demonstrate for you today is a.superman exercise youre going to be.down here on your stomach once again.arms extended over your head now what.were going to do lift our arms and.chest up off of the floor but then i.also want you to try to lift your legs.up off of the floor i want your knees to.get up off the ground so this is what it.looks like right here chest and knees.come up off of the floor and then return.back down to that starting position and.so thats what that full superman looks.like weve got a lot more motion going.at the lower back so this does have.potential to be a little more.aggravating but if youve worked up to.this and if youve done it the right way.this should be a very good exercise to.minimize some of those sciatic nerve.symptoms and those that sciatic nerve.pain about three sets of ten is what i.typically recommend for people on those.superman exercises as far as your,what's up guys jared beckstrand here.doctor of physical therapy tone and.titan and in this video i want to share.with you five of the best core.strengthening exercises for your sciatic.nerve pain what is sciatica well it's.pain or numbness or teeny week that runs.down the back of your leg most of the.time caused by some problem up here in.your lower back if we can teach you the.right strengthening and stabilization.exercises to help minimize some of that.problem you're going to feel a lot.better that is my goal with this video.in fact in an effort to serve you even.better this is part two of a two-part.video series of home exercises that you.can do for your sciatic nerve pain in.video one i showed you the best.stretches and mobilization techniques to.help to eliminate your pain and help.your sciatic symptoms to feel better in.this video what we need to follow that.up with is the right core strengthening.and lumbar stabilization techniques in.order to keep your sciatic nerve.symptoms away that's exactly what i hope.to share with you in this video if.you're interested in checking out part.one check out the link in the.description down below i will also link.it at the end of this video and i hope.that helps you out that being said grab.some space on the floor first exercise.is coming your way now.one of the best ways to strengthen your.lower back muscles is to actually train.them with your hips one of my favorite.ways to do that at home is with some.bridges let's go ahead and get started.lay down on your back with both of your.knees bent what i'm going to do now is.contract your glutes squeeze your butt.together and then use that contraction.to lift your hips up off the floor again.the emphasis is right here in the butt.muscles in those glute muscles we're.going to hold this for about three to.five seconds and then we're gonna come.right back down keep in mind the higher.you go the more chance that it has to be.irritating to your lower back go up as.high as you can pain-free try to keep.this in as pain-free range as you can i.like to tell people we're going to shoot.for about 10 to 20 repetitions and then.we're going to repeat that three times.exercise number two is one of my.favorite stabilization exercises for.your lower back this is going to be a.verb dog we're going to come right down.here on all fours and then in this.position so i've got my hands under my.shoulders my knees are under my hips.i'm going to extend my right arm.straight in front of me as my left leg.goes straight back and then we're going.to return to the starting position and.then repeat that over here on the other.side the primary problem that i.encounter with this is people will want.to roll their hips they lose the.stability in their back so as i come.here you see how my hip opened up.towards you opened up towards the camera.try not to let that happen we're going.to bring the hip down so that the hips.stay parallel to the floor throughout.that whole exercise again about 10 to 20.reps per side and then we're going to.repeat that three times.one great way to improve stability in.your lower back is to improve lateral.stability in your core we're talking.about the oblique muscles and the lumbar.pair spinals the quadratus lumborum my.favorite way to do that is with some.side points so.i like to start with a modified side.plank you're going to be on your right.elbow my right elbow is underneath my.right shoulder my right knee is bent my.left leg is out straight i'm then going.to kick on these lateral hip muscles and.lateral pore muscles to lift my hips up.towards the ceiling.as i'm up in this modified modified.plank position i'm on my right elbow and.the outside of my right knee i should.have a straight line nose belly button.down between my knees i'd hold that for.about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that.three times on each side if that's too.easy what we can do is get into a full.side plank i just extended my right leg.out now as i get up into this position.i'm once again on my right elbow but now.i'm on the outside of my right foot.instead of on the outside of my right.knee that's what a full plank looks like.a full side plank once again should be a.straight line nose belly button between.my knees down between my ankles now.we're really trying to engage these core.muscles you can actually draw your belly.button in while you're holding this.exercise just a great exercise for.lateral stability you're going to hold.this for 20 to 30 seconds and then.you're going to repeat that three times.on each side.next let's do a little more focus work.on that lower back specifically this is.going to be well in pilates it's called.a swimmer so we call these swimmers.that's what i refer to in my clinic.you're going to lay down on your stomach.with your legs.legs out straight your arms extended.above you right here.similar to a bird dog i'm going to lift.my right arm up off of the floor at the.same time i lift my left leg off of the.floor and then return to the starting.position and then repeat left arm right.leg and so these swimmers looks just.like this just another great way that we.can stabilize that lower back there's.not really much movement occurring it's.a very safe position for your spine to.be in but we're working all of the.muscles that are going to stabilize your.back as we're doing these swimmers.looks just like this we're going to.repeat this once again about 10 to 20.repetitions on each side and then we're.going to repeat that three times.usually what i'll tell people is we'll.use the swimmers as a way to get to the.next exercise a lot of times this is a.little more aggressive but it's my.personal favorite way to strengthen the.entire spine last exercise that i want.to demonstrate for you today is a.superman exercise you're going to be.down here on your stomach once again.arms extended over your head now what.we're going to do lift our arms and.chest up off of the floor but then i.also want you to try to lift your legs.up off of the floor i want your knees to.get up off the ground so this is what it.looks like right here chest and knees.come up off of the floor and then return.back down to that starting position and.so that's what that full superman looks.like we've got a lot more motion going.at the lower back so this does have.potential to be a little more.aggravating but if you've worked up to.this and if you've done it the right way.this should be a very good exercise to.minimize some of those sciatic nerve.symptoms and those that sciatic nerve.pain about three sets of ten is what i.typically recommend for people on those.superman exercises as far as your.frequency with these i want you to just.do these exercises once a day you don't.need to necessarily do it more than that.but consistency is key so make sure you.come back regularly watch this video.give the cues that you need and perform.the exercises the right way so that you.can see improvement of course if you're.interested in checking out that first.video those stretches and mobilizations.to help your sciatic nerve feel better.check it out i've got it linked

this.for 15 to 20 repetitions.three to four sets avoid having the.tennis ball.fall towards the ground throughout the.whole exercise.this will help lengthen and strengthen.the muscles in the feet.and the calves to help support the feet.and reduce.foot pain and leg pain by squeezing the.ball.between the feet it will help promote.you squeezing the muscles that create.an arch in the foot like other natural.curves in the body.like the spine arches are very important.to support our body weight,foot pronation also known as.flat feet is a common issue for many.people it can cause pain.in the hips the lower back the knees the.ankles and obviously your feet.it causes your feet to roll inwards and.create tibial torsion where your knees.bow.in and that can cause stress and strain.in your hips and lower back as well.it shifts your weight into other.structures such as ligaments.joints and muscles have to compensate.and that can cause.pain and also promote arthritis or.degenerate change.a lot of people self-diagnose themselves.for plaster.fasciitis which is a irritation of.the connective tissue under their foot.and i'm going to show you.in this video some short term things you.can do to prevent.this pain or improve this pain i hope.these exercises and stretches help you.as much as they helped me and my.patients calf raises.with a ball sit on a bench.or a chair that will allow you to have.your knees.bent at approximately 90 degrees and.pinch.a tennis ball with both heels this.creates.slight foot eversion meaning it rolls.your ankles.outwards and your heels inwards then.push the

natural.curves in the body.like the spine arches are very important.to support our body weight.a paper was published in the journal of.sports rehabilitation in 2019 october.on the research of intrinsic foot.exercises.and how it affected the novel color drop.in the foot.and foot pain aka the drop of the foot.arch.after six weeks of the exercises.patients reported back with the.reduction of pain.and the decrease of foot pronation and.navicular drop.meaning the reduction of flat feet.so if you're suffering from foot pain.plantar fasciitis or flat feet.please try out the exercises in this.video weighted.dorsiflexion start by sitting on a small.stool.with a weight lifting plate rested on.your knees.drive your knees forward as possible and.pass your toes.without your heels coming off the ground.do this by leaning forward and pressing.gently on top of the weight lifting.plate.try to shift slightly and slowly side to.side.and explore which areas you need to work.on more.this is a mobilization type stretch.for the calf muscles and to increase.dorsiflexion in the ankle.hold this position for about 30 seconds.or 10 deep long breaths.have a break for about 30 seconds and.then repeat the exercise again.four to five times once you are.comfortable.and confident of not losing your balance.try to do the stretch on each leg.without the stool.and lean majority of your weight over.one leg.this will force you to go more deeper.into a stretch with an.increase of range of motion for ankle.mobility.the same weight lifting plate is now.technically two times heavier on.the ankle joint since the weight is only.acting on one leg.and not two if you don't have a.weightlifting plate.you can always be creative and use.something heavy to press.down on top of your knees here i'm using.a large bag of rice you can use a large.bag of potatoes if you like.in this technique try to be relaxed as.possible.and feel the body weight pressing evenly.on the ball of your feet and the heel at.no.point should you feel your heel lift off.the floor.if it does lift off the floor and you.feel most of your body weight.on the ball of your feet and your toes.the exercise is no longer.working to improve ankle dorsiflexion.or stretching your calf muscles i know i.mentioned.to lean your knees past your toes and a.common misunderstanding.that it is dangerous to do so i used to.think this myself.there are even old outdated textbooks.out there.saying that you should not squat have.your knees past your toes.but if you do further reading and.research.doing this will allow you to utilize the.natural full ranges of motion.of your ankles and your knees which many.athletes such as martial artists.olympic weight lifters and gymnasts.benefit from this ability to move.and be strong in this range of motion.will not only allow you to move better.stronger but also prevent injuries such.as level back injuries.foot self-release sit on a chair.and place a lacrosse ball or massage.ball on the ground.position the sole of your foot on the.ball and gently roll your foot over the.ball.spend more time around the tender areas.roll the lacrosse ball up and down from.the heel to the ball of your foot.allowing the structures of your feet to.relax and almost.wrap around the ball roll up and down.under your foot.for 20 strokes on each tender area and.move on to the next.make sure you return to the tender area.again.four to six times and repeat the process.once you are ready to add more pressure.on the feet you can.stand up and add more body weight onto.the bottom of your feet.but please be careful even for me this.is quite painful to do.this will passively move the joints of.the feet whilst.massaging and stripping the muscles in.the feet.this can help release tight muscles.reducing spasming.in the feet and the legs therefore.reducing pain and tenderness in other.areas such as the leg.i'll put a link in the description box.below on where to get this massage ball.once again guys

muscles that create.an arch in the foot like other natural.curves in the body.like the spine arches are very important.to support our body weight.a paper was published in the journal of.sports rehabilitation in 2019 october.on the research of intrinsic foot.exercises.and how it affected the novel color drop.in the foot.and foot pain aka the drop of the foot.arch.after six weeks of the

dqtqS_OVDGw,How one can do a foot self-release exercise with a lacrosse ball or a massage ball? ,"(327, 396)",as level back injuries.foot selfrelease sit on a chair.and place a lacrosse ball or massage.ball on the ground.position the sole of your foot on the.ball and gently roll your foot over the.ball.spend more time around the tender areas.roll the lacrosse ball up and down from.the heel to the ball of your foot.allowing the structures of your feet to.relax and almost.wrap around the ball roll up and down.under your foot.for 20 strokes on each tender area and.move on to the next.make sure you return to the tender area.again.four to six times and repeat the process.once you are ready to add more pressure.on the feet you can.stand up and add more body weight onto.the bottom of your feet.but please be careful even for me this.is quite painful to do.this will passively move the joints of.the feet whilst.massaging and stripping the muscles in.the feet.this can help release tight muscles.reducing spasming.in the feet and the legs therefore.reducing pain and tenderness in other.areas such as the leg.ill put a link in the description box,foot pronation also known as.flat feet is a common issue for many.people it can cause pain.in the hips the lower back the knees the.ankles and obviously your feet.it causes your feet to roll inwards and.create tibial torsion where your knees.bow.in and that can cause stress and strain.in your hips and lower back as well.it shifts your weight into other.structures such as ligaments.joints and muscles have to compensate.and that can cause.pain and also promote arthritis or.degenerate change.a lot of people self-diagnose themselves.for plaster.fasciitis which is a irritation of.the connective tissue under their foot.and i'm going to show you.in this video some short term things you.can do to prevent.this pain or improve this pain i hope.these exercises and stretches help you.as much as they helped me and my.patients calf raises.with a ball sit on a bench.or a chair that will allow you to have.your knees.bent at approximately 90 degrees and.pinch.a tennis ball with both heels this.creates.slight foot eversion meaning it rolls.your ankles.outwards and your heels inwards then.push the balls.of your feet into the ground to lift the.heels.up contracting and squeezing the.calf muscles like a calf raise.and visualize squeezing and creating an.arch.under your foot at the same time do this.for 15 to 20 repetitions.three to four sets avoid having the.tennis ball.fall towards the ground throughout the.whole exercise.this will help lengthen and strengthen.the muscles in the feet.and the calves to help support the feet.and reduce.foot pain and leg pain by squeezing the.ball.between the feet it will help promote.you squeezing the muscles that create.an arch in the foot like other natural.curves in the body.like the spine arches are very important.to support our body weight.a paper was published in the journal of.sports rehabilitation in 2019 october.on the research of intrinsic foot.exercises.and how it affected the novel color drop.in the foot.and foot pain aka the drop of the foot.arch.after six weeks of the exercises.patients reported back with the.reduction of pain.and the decrease of foot pronation and.navicular drop.meaning the reduction of flat feet.so if you're suffering from foot pain.plantar fasciitis or flat feet.please try out the exercises in this.video weighted.dorsiflexion start by sitting on a small.stool.with a weight lifting plate rested on.your knees.drive your knees forward as possible and.pass your toes.without your heels coming off the ground.do this by leaning forward and pressing.gently on top of the weight lifting.plate.try to shift slightly and slowly side to.side.and explore which areas you need to work.on more.this is a mobilization type stretch.for the calf muscles and to increase.dorsiflexion in the ankle.hold this position for about 30 seconds.or 10 deep long breaths.have a break for about 30 seconds and.then repeat the exercise again.four to five times once you are.comfortable.and confident of not losing your balance.try to do the stretch on each leg.without the stool.and lean majority of your weight over.one leg.this will force you to go more deeper.into a stretch with an.increase of range of motion for ankle.mobility.the same weight lifting plate is now.technically two times heavier on.the ankle joint since the weight is only.acting on one leg.and not two if you don't have a.weightlifting plate.you can always be creative and use.something heavy to press.down on top of your knees here i'm using.a large bag of rice you can use a large.bag of potatoes if you like.in this technique try to be relaxed as.possible.and feel the body weight pressing evenly.on the ball of your feet and the heel at.no.point should you feel your heel lift off.the floor.if it does lift off the floor and you.feel most of your body weight.on the ball of your feet and your toes.the exercise is no longer.working to improve ankle dorsiflexion.or stretching your calf muscles i know i.mentioned.to lean your knees past your toes and a.common misunderstanding.that it is dangerous to do so i used to.think this myself.there are even old outdated textbooks.out there.saying that you should not squat have.your knees past your toes.but if you do further reading and.research.doing this will allow you to utilize the.natural full ranges of motion.of your ankles and your knees which many.athletes such as martial artists.olympic weight lifters and gymnasts.benefit from this ability to move.and be strong in this range of motion.will not only allow you to move better.stronger but also prevent injuries such.as level back injuries.foot self-release sit on a chair.and place a lacrosse ball or massage.ball on the ground.position the sole of your foot on the.ball and gently roll your foot over the.ball.spend more time around the tender areas.roll the lacrosse ball up and down from.the heel to the ball of your foot.allowing the structures of your feet to.relax and almost.wrap around the ball roll up and down.under your foot.for 20 strokes on each tender area and.move on to the next.make sure you return to the tender area.again.four to six times and repeat the process.once you are ready to add more pressure.on the feet you can.stand up and add more body weight onto.the bottom of your feet.but please be careful even for me this.is quite painful to do.this will passively move the joints of.the feet whilst.massaging and stripping the muscles in.the feet.this can help release tight muscles.reducing spasming.in the feet and the legs therefore.reducing pain and tenderness in other.areas such as the leg.i'll put a link in the

flash.of blood so that lets you know you hit a.vein and the way the blood comes down is.when she takes one of the tools and then.inserts it in to the plastic hub that.shes holding in her hand and

is.the crease of the elbow it's gonna go.about three to four inches above it and.once she puts on the tourniquet so I ask.the patient if it's too tight okay and.then that's the patient of pump their.fist a couple times and she's got a.puppy.well palpation is where she's gonna just.feel for a vein and a vein will bounce.back on her fingers and she'll know.that's a good thing so you never go by.sight you always go by touch to feel for.a vein and he has a pretty good thing.right in the middle and this is the vein.that we this the first vein that we use.and fool out of me.just and then just choice two and three.once she has popaty she's gonna clean.the area and there is a proper way of.cleaning the area what you're gonna do.is you can start from the middle go.circular out.that's cleaning area okay and she's.gonna grab her needle which is gonna be.a butterfly and with the butterfly she's.gonna pinch the wings and I'm Catholic.but and then the angle she needs to.create an angle about 15 degrees so go a.little bit more 15 degrees and that.should before she goes in she's gonna.tell pastry she's gonna feel a little.pinch and the one good thing about a.butterfly it's a smaller needle so it.hurts less and the other thing is.whenever you have stucked a big needle.inside the vein you're gonna see a flash.of blood so that lets you know you hit a.vein and the way the blood comes down is.when she takes one of the tools and then.inserts it in to the plastic hub that.she's holding in her hand and then.you'll see the blood just come down and.collect into the tool and then she'll.take another one the next one and kick.that out yeah after that she'll take off.the tourniquet tell the patient over.these are Lisa fist.yes dad and then and then take the gauze.pad or suppose of that and then the cost.then after that put the band-aid on a.patient and the.[Music],"{'(0.0, 5.58)': '[Music]', '(301.85, 310.66)': '[Music]', '(68.4, 71.36)': '[Music]', '(86.1, 92.32)': '[Music]', '(5.45,

T43753AfaKY,What YWTL exercises should i do to improve my posture and reduce the neck hump?,"(75, 150)",first exercise is a.ywtl exercise and essentially what were.trying to do is to stretch out.straighten out the whole thoracic spine.from the top to the bottom and its very.very simple so what you do you raise.your arms in the air hand palms facing.forward arms in the air and you really.pull your arms backwards keep your.elbows straight pull your arms backwards.and hold this for about 30 seconds if.you can and then from the y from the y.position we go to the w position so this.is w position so you pull your arms back.and make sure your elbows are pointing.down and the same thing hold this for.about 30 seconds.now after 30 seconds you spread out your.arms elbows or your palms still facing.forward so you make a t ywt so again.putting your arms back again.and 30 seconds and then were going down.to the l elbows in the side.arms out and really pull your.arms.your forearms back and thats an l.position and again hold that for uh.about 30 seconds so thats exercise.number one why.wtl really good exercise to get rid of.that.dow just hump.in the back of your neck the second.exercise id like to show you.for the neck hump the buffalo hump very,hi uh i'm sure some of you know what i'm.talking about if i talk about a buffalo.hump or a neck hump or a dowager's hump.and it's essentially a hump that you can.have at the the base of your of your.spine and all it is is uh it's a deposit.of fatty tissue.but it's lay there to protect the spine.and the reason why their bodies lay that.fatty tissue there is because people.have got faulty posture so they have.rounded shoulders they have the chin.sticking forward there's too much.pressure going on on this area here and.that can give you a buffalo hump or a.neck hump.now the good news is there's something.you can do about it and i'll give you.three really simple very effective.exercises for you to help you with it.shouldn't take too long it's persistency.that that's the key um but the first.thing you need to do is sort out your.posture so make sure you're nice and and.upright shoulders back chin in so you.don't create that constant tension on.this on this area there um okay so.before i continue with the exercises um.i really enjoy making these videos for.you but if you could just help me out.and just like it or comment in the box.below i really really would would.appreciate appreciate it um okay so the.first exercise is a.ywtl exercise and essentially what we're.trying to do is to stretch out.straighten out the whole thoracic spine.from the top to the bottom and it's very.very simple so what you do you raise.your arms in the air hand palms facing.forward arms in the air and you really.pull your arms backwards keep your.elbows straight pull your arms backwards.and hold this for about 30 seconds if.you can and then from the y from the y.position we go to the w position so this.is w position so you pull your arms back.and make sure your elbows are pointing.down and the same thing hold this for.about 30 seconds.now after 30 seconds you spread out your.arms elbows or your palms still facing.forward so you make a t ywt so again.putting your arms back again.and 30 seconds and then we're going down.to the l elbows in the side.arms out and really pull your.arms.your forearms back and that's an l.position and again hold that for uh.about 30 seconds so that's exercise.number one why.wtl really good exercise to get rid of.that.dow just hump.in the back of your neck the second.exercise i'd like to show you.for the neck hump the buffalo hump very.effective as well simple again and.effective um what you need to do is.place your hands behind your back grab.your wrist.pull your arms.straighten your elbows and pull your.arms back make sure you squeeze your.shoulder blades together and then you.tilt your head back.and you hold this for about 30 seconds.and whilst you're tilting back you're.breathing out.my final exercise to combat the neck.hump or the buffalo hump is probably one.of my one of my favorites a simple.exercise to do all you need is a is a.wall so make sure in this case do the.right arm slide the hand.up on the wall make sure it's nice and.high don't do it here make sure your.hands really arms really high up and.then what you need to do is you need to.in this case right arms up i'm going to.turn to my right and we're going to tilt.my head backwards another to rest here.for about 15 seconds before i come back.again and again turn to the right and.tilt backwards and hold this for about.15 seconds now make sure you don't get.dizzy be careful with this it's a really.really really good exercise that's one.side and obviously you need to do the.other side as well so left arm up and.i'm turning to the left and i'm tilting.my head backwards and hold this for.about.10 to 15 seconds really good exercise.probably one of my favorites and it's.very specifically targets that area of.your neck where you have that bit of a.of a hump.often people who experience a neck hump.or a buffalo hump.also experience a bit of neck pain as.well i've done some really nice videos.good videos for you.on next stretch it's really effective.next strategy so check out our channel.our youtube channel and you can find the.video there as

T43753AfaKY,What simple and effective  exercise will improve my posture and reduce the neck hump?,"(155, 180)",effective as well simple again and.effective um what you need to do is.place your hands behind your back grab.your wrist.pull your arms.straighten your elbows and pull your.arms back make sure you squeeze your.shoulder blades together and then you.tilt your head back.and you hold this for about 30 seconds.and whilst youre tilting back youre.breathing out,hi uh i'm sure some of you know what i'm.talking about if i talk about a buffalo.hump or a neck hump or a dowager's hump.and it's essentially a hump that you can.have at the the base of your of your.spine and all it is is uh it's a deposit.of fatty tissue.but it's lay there to protect the spine.and the reason why their bodies lay that.fatty tissue there is because people.have got faulty posture so they have.rounded shoulders they have the chin.sticking forward there's too much.pressure going on on this area here and.that can give you a buffalo hump or a.neck hump.now the good news is there's something.you can do about it and i'll give you.three really simple very effective.exercises for you to help you with it.shouldn't take too long it's persistency.that that's the key um but the first.thing you need to do is sort out your.posture so make sure you're nice and and.upright shoulders back chin in so you.don't create that constant tension on.this on this area there um okay so.before i continue with the exercises um.i really enjoy making these videos for.you but if you could just help me out.and just like it or comment in the box.below i really really would would.appreciate appreciate it um okay so the.first exercise is a.ywtl exercise and essentially what we're.trying to do is to stretch out.straighten out the whole thoracic spine.from the top to the bottom and it's very.very simple so what you do you raise.your arms in the air hand palms facing.forward arms in the air and you really.pull your arms backwards keep your.elbows straight pull your arms backwards.and hold this for about 30 seconds if.you can and then from the y from the y.position we go to the w position so this.is w position so you pull your arms back.and make sure your elbows are pointing.down and the same thing hold this for.about 30 seconds.now after 30 seconds you spread out your.arms elbows or your palms still facing.forward so you make a t ywt so again.putting your arms back again.and 30 seconds and then we're going down.to the l elbows in the side.arms out and really pull your.arms.your forearms back and that's an l.position and again hold that for uh.about 30 seconds so that's exercise.number one why.wtl really good exercise to get rid of.that.dow just hump.in the back of your neck the second.exercise i'd like to show you.for the neck hump the buffalo hump very.effective as well simple again and.effective um what you need to do is.place your hands behind your back grab.your wrist.pull your arms.straighten your elbows and pull your.arms back make sure you squeeze your.shoulder blades together and then you.tilt your head back.and you hold this for about 30 seconds.and whilst you're tilting back you're.breathing out.my final exercise to combat the neck.hump or the buffalo hump is probably one.of my one of my favorites a simple.exercise to do all you need is a is a.wall so make sure in this case do the.right arm slide the hand.up on the wall make sure it's nice and.high don't do it here make sure your.hands really arms really high up and.then what you need to do is you need to.in this case right arms up i'm going to.turn to my right and we're going to tilt.my head backwards another to rest here.for about 15 seconds before i come back.again and again turn to the right and.tilt backwards and hold this for about.15 seconds now make sure you don't get.dizzy be careful with this it's a really.really really good exercise that's one.side and obviously you need to do the.other side as well so left arm up and.i'm turning to the left and i'm tilting.my head backwards and hold this for.about.10 to 15 seconds really good exercise.probably one of my favorites and it's.very specifically targets that area of.your neck where you have that bit of a.of a hump.often people who experience a neck hump.or a buffalo hump.also experience a bit of neck pain as.well i've done some really nice videos.good videos for you.on next stretch it's really effective.next strategy so check out our channel.our youtube channel and you can find the.video there as

xYFeFFzFftw,How to relieve neck pain with an upper trap stretch? ,"(22, 102)",exercises towards the end so the first stretch is an upper trap stretch a lot.of times when you have neck pain those upper trap muscles really get tight and.theyll cause more neck pain because theyre they come up all the way up.those upper traps and connect to the neck area and then come down into the.shoulders so theres a couple different ways you can stretch the upper trap the.one I usually show you is where youre kind of sitting on your hand today Im.going to show you it a little bit differently but if you have some.shoulder issues this might be a little uncomfortable so do which one is more.comfortable for you this time youre just going to place your hand behind.your back so my hands just kind of in the middle of my lower back and my.elbows to the side right here so Im keeping it close to my body this is the.side I want to stretch Im gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over.almost where Im touching the top of my ear then Im gonna gently pull my ear.over towards that side keeping my shoulder down low getting that stretch.right through here and youre gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds if you want.more of a stretch take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the.floor or if youre sitting in a chair down towards the chair and thatll give.you that extra stretch in there 30 seconds doing that 3 times on each side.but remember with a stretch you dont want it to be painful you want it to be.tension where its that hurt so good feeling so then the next stretch is,"hey everybody it's doctor Jo, and today I'm going to show you my top 5 ways to.reduce neck pain so let's get started so.so before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure and click on the.subscribe button down below, and you can always find me at askdoctorjocom.so we're gonna start off with some stretches, and then we'll move into the.exercises towards the end so the first stretch is an upper trap stretch a lot.of times when you have neck pain, those upper trap muscles really get tight, and.they'll cause more neck pain because they're they come up all the way up.those upper traps and connect to the neck area and then come down into the.shoulders so there's a couple different ways you can stretch the upper trap the.one I usually show you is where you're kind of sitting on your hand today I'm.going to show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some.shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable so do which one is more.comfortable for you this time you're just going to place your hand behind.your back so my hands just kind of in the middle of my lower back and my.elbows to the side right here so I'm keeping it close to my body this is the.side I want to stretch I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over.almost where I'm touching the top of my ear then I'm gonna gently pull my ear.over towards that side keeping my shoulder down low getting that stretch.right through here and you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds if you want.more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the.floor or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair, and that'll give.you that extra stretch in there 30 seconds doing that 3 times on each side.but remember with a stretch you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be.tension where it's that hurt so good feeling so then the next stretch is.going to be the levator scapulae stretch and that levator SCAP muscle is the one.that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades and so a lot of times when we're.holding stress, we overwork that muscle and it tightens and we kind of sit up.in this position, and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that.muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area.and can put a lot of pain and stress on that area so the way to stretch that one.out is this one's going to be a little bit differently, so.again you're going to use your arm but this time it's going to go up so you can.either just raise your arm, or I like to kind of put it back this way where my.elbow is kind of pointing up towards the ceiling so I'd be stretching this side.now so you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to.stretch and all this does is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down, and.so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch so again if this is.uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're.gonna get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that.shoulder blade down while you stretch the important part of this stretch is.you're not bringing your head down you're not bringing it over to the side.like for that upper trap stretch but you're bringing it down kind of an angle.where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite.knee so it's not down and then this way, it's turning your head kind of rotating.it and then coming down so elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up, and.over behind the head and then you're pulling down and you should feel that.stretch in that upper neck area, that levator scapulae muscle that goes.through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade so again.you're getting that nice stretch in there, holding it for 30 seconds, coming.back up, three times on each side because if you're having neck pain, even if the.neck pain is on one side, if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching.both sides because that's really just gonna loosen up that whole neck area so.another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use.heat or cold therapy, and the folks at bio med DB Design LLC sent me their.sunny Bay hands-free neck wrap and so what I really like about using heat.therapy and cold therapy is, the general rule if you're doing stretches and.exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles and then the cold.therapy afterwards so after you've gotten everything excited and working.use that cold therapy to cool it back down and so what I really like about.their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it, and you can use cold therapy.with it so you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can.put it in the freezer and cool it back down to.the cold therapy they've also changed their design a little bit you might have.seen me talk about these in the in the past, but they added an elastic.band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck.a little bit better and so once you get that band in you can really move around.you know I can bend my head I can turn to the side and it's not gonna fall off.so it makes it really functional where you can go about and do your things, but.you're still either getting that heat if you need it or if you need that cold.afterwards you can do that as well and so it's really nice also because.it's not plugged in, so you can move around with it on you know sometimes.with traditional heating pads you actually have to plug it in and stay in.one spot, but you don't have to do it with that they also come in different.sizes in different colors they have an extra-large version, so if you need a.little bit more length on the wrap around you have that option as well and.it also has that elastic band so it's really nice they use you know all.natural products on the inside so it's you know sometimes flax seeds sometimes.it's lavender, and so they use different kinds with that as well so if you're.interested in purchasing their product, make sure and click on the link up there.so now we're going to go into some exercises once you've gotten everything.stretched out, warm it up first, get it stretched out, then you want to go into.the exercises so one of my favorite exercises if you've seen some of my.videos for neck pains is chin tucks a chin tuck is really great because it's.kind of a stretch and an exercise combined together, but it's a great way.to help get you back in good posture a lot of times with neck pain it comes.from people like this either at their computer or if they're focusing on.something they really bring that head forward, and that puts a lot of stress on.the neck causing pain so a chin tuck is super simple you've probably seen in.some of my videos where you use my finger as a target you don't have to do.that the great thing about a chin tuck is you can do it anywhere, it is super easy.people might look at you a little funny when you're doing it, but it's easy to do.and so all you're doing is just like it sounds you're tucking your chin back and.in, but it's not down towards your chest so you're just taking your chin keeping.it level, you want to keep your head level, you're.not coming down or not coming up, but you're just bringing your head in almost.you know if you have a wall or something behind you your chair behind you just.try and push your head into the wall or the chair and you see you.have lots of little chins right there and so you just want to hold that.position you might feel some tightness in the back, you might feel some.tightness in the front as well, and hold that for about 3 to 5 seconds, and then.relax you can do those 5 times you can do them several times throughout the day,.but again you're just taking that chin tucking it in, and getting that you're.working the muscles and you're stretching the muscles at the same time.so it's a really great exercise combination stretch to really kind of.reset everything and a lot of times just doing two or three you can.already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position your head's not.forward so much, so I really like that exercise and then the last one is just a another.super simple one that you can do all the time which is going to be.an isometric exercise a lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a.little bit out of alignment or need something like a pop, doing an isometric.exercise not only help strengthen it but sometimes it will help adjust your neck.as well so the one that I'm going to do for you today and and you can follow.along with me is a side bent isometric exercise but what isometric exercises.are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle, so.if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but.you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right.now so the motion you're gonna be doing is.this way keeping your shoulders down your head.going over, but your head's not actually gonna move you're gonna place your hand.on the side of your forehead here on your temple area, and then you're just.gonna push into your hands so see my head's not moving you might see it move.just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here.on this side when you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds,.but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a.little uncomfortable maybe do thirty to forty percent of as hard as you think.you can push so pushing over to the side this is the motion I'm doing but I'm not.going anywhere I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on.each side instead of do them all on one side I just like to.alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break so.that 3 to 5 second hold maybe doing 5 on each side and that should really again.not only help strengthen the muscle it might help get you back into alignment a.little bit, and just get that neck pain out of there in general so there you.have it, those are my top 5 ways to reduce neck pain if you'd like to.purchase the sunny baton neck wrap hands-free, make sure and click up there,.and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down there and remember be safe,.have fun, and I hope you feel

xYFeFFzFftw,How to relieve neck pain with a levator scapulae stretch? ,"(102, 223)",tension where its that hurt so good feeling so then the next stretch is.going to be the levator scapulae stretch and that levator SCAP muscle is the one.that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades and so a lot of times when were.holding stress we overwork that muscle and it tightens and we kind of sit up.in this position and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that.muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area.and can put a lot of pain and stress on that area so the way to stretch that one.out is this ones going to be a little bit differently so.again youre going to use your arm but this time its going to go up so you can.either just raise your arm or I like to kind of put it back this way where my.elbow is kind of pointing up towards the ceiling so Id be stretching this side.now so youre putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to.stretch and all this does is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down and.so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch so again if this is.uncomfortable for your shoulder you dont have to do that part but youre.gonna get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that.shoulder blade down while you stretch the important part of this stretch is.youre not bringing your head down youre not bringing it over to the side.like for that upper trap stretch but youre bringing it down kind of an angle.where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite.knee so its not down and then this way its turning your head kind of rotating.it and then coming down so elbow up nose towards the opposite knee hand up and.over behind the head and then youre pulling down and you should feel that.stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapulae muscle that goes.through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade so again.youre getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming.back up three times on each side because if youre having neck pain even if the.neck pain is on one side if you have the time Id really recommend stretching.both sides because thats really just gonna loosen up that whole neck area so,"hey everybody it's doctor Jo, and today I'm going to show you my top 5 ways to.reduce neck pain so let's get started so.so before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure and click on the.subscribe button down below, and you can always find me at askdoctorjocom.so we're gonna start off with some stretches, and then we'll move into the.exercises towards the end so the first stretch is an upper trap stretch a lot.of times when you have neck pain, those upper trap muscles really get tight, and.they'll cause more neck pain because they're they come up all the way up.those upper traps and connect to the neck area and then come down into the.shoulders so there's a couple different ways you can stretch the upper trap the.one I usually show you is where you're kind of sitting on your hand today I'm.going to show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some.shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable so do which one is more.comfortable for you this time you're just going to place your hand behind.your back so my hands just kind of in the middle of my lower back and my.elbows to the side right here so I'm keeping it close to my body this is the.side I want to stretch I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over.almost where I'm touching the top of my ear then I'm gonna gently pull my ear.over towards that side keeping my shoulder down low getting that stretch.right through here and you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds if you want.more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the.floor or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair, and that'll give.you that extra stretch in there 30 seconds doing that 3 times on each side.but remember with a stretch you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be.tension where it's that hurt so good feeling so then the next stretch is.going to be the levator scapulae stretch and that levator SCAP muscle is the one.that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades and so a lot of times when we're.holding stress, we overwork that muscle and it tightens and we kind of sit up.in this position, and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that.muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area.and can put a lot of pain and stress on that area so the way to stretch that one.out is this one's going to be a little bit differently, so.again you're going to use your arm but this time it's going to go up so you can.either just raise your arm, or I like to kind of put it back this way where my.elbow is kind of pointing up towards the ceiling so I'd be stretching this side.now so you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to.stretch and all this does is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down, and.so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch so again if this is.uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're.gonna get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that.shoulder blade down while you stretch the important part of this stretch is.you're not bringing your head down you're not bringing it over to the side.like for that upper trap stretch but you're bringing it down kind of an angle.where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite.knee so it's not down and then this way, it's turning your head kind of rotating.it and then coming down so elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up, and.over behind the head and then you're pulling down and you should feel that.stretch in that upper neck area, that levator scapulae muscle that goes.through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade so again.you're getting that nice stretch in there, holding it for 30 seconds, coming.back up, three times on each side because if you're having neck pain, even if the.neck pain is on one side, if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching.both sides because that's really just gonna loosen up that whole neck area so.another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use.heat or cold therapy, and the folks at bio med DB Design LLC sent me their.sunny Bay hands-free neck wrap and so what I really like about using heat.therapy and cold therapy is, the general rule if you're doing stretches and.exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles and then the cold.therapy afterwards so after you've gotten everything excited and working.use that cold therapy to cool it back down and so what I really like about.their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it, and you can use cold therapy.with it so you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can.put it in the freezer and cool it back down to.the cold therapy they've also changed their design a little bit you might have.seen me talk about these in the in the past, but they added an elastic.band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck.a little bit better and so once you get that band in you can really move around.you know I can bend my head I can turn to the side and it's not gonna fall off.so it makes it really functional where you can go about and do your things, but.you're still either getting that heat if you need it or if you need that cold.afterwards you can do that as well and so it's really nice also because.it's not plugged in, so you can move around with it on you know sometimes.with traditional heating pads you actually have to plug it in and stay in.one spot, but you don't have to do it with that they also come in different.sizes in different colors they have an extra-large version, so if you need a.little bit more length on the wrap around you have that option as well and.it also has that elastic band so it's really nice they use you know all.natural products on the inside so it's you know sometimes flax seeds sometimes.it's lavender, and so they use different kinds with that as well so if you're.interested in purchasing their product, make sure and click on the link up there.so now we're going to go into some exercises once you've gotten everything.stretched out, warm it up first, get it stretched out, then you want to go into.the exercises so one of my favorite exercises if you've seen some of my.videos for neck pains is chin tucks a chin tuck is really great because it's.kind of a stretch and an exercise combined together, but it's a great way.to help get you back in good posture a lot of times with neck pain it comes.from people like this either at their computer or if they're focusing on.something they really bring that head forward, and that puts a lot of stress on.the neck causing pain so a chin tuck is super simple you've probably seen in.some of my videos where you use my finger as a target you don't have to do.that the great thing about a chin tuck is you can do it anywhere, it is super easy.people might look at you a little funny when you're doing it, but it's easy to do.and so all you're doing is just like it sounds you're tucking your chin back and.in, but it's not down towards your chest so you're just taking your chin keeping.it level, you want to keep your head level, you're.not coming down or not coming up, but you're just bringing your head in almost.you know if you have a wall or something behind you your chair behind you just.try and push your head into the wall or the chair and you see you.have lots of little chins right there and so you just want to hold that.position you might feel some tightness in the back, you might feel some.tightness in the front as well, and hold that for about 3 to 5 seconds, and then.relax you can do those 5 times you can do them several times throughout the day,.but again you're just taking that chin tucking it in, and getting that you're.working the muscles and you're stretching the muscles at the same time.so it's a really great exercise combination stretch to really kind of.reset everything and a lot of times just doing two or three you can.already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position your head's not.forward so much, so I really like that exercise and then the last one is just a another.super simple one that you can do all the time which is going to be.an isometric exercise a lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a.little bit out of alignment or need something like a pop, doing an isometric.exercise not only help strengthen it but sometimes it will help adjust your neck.as well so the one that I'm going to do for you today and and you can follow.along with me is a side bent isometric exercise but what isometric exercises.are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle, so.if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but.you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right.now so the motion you're gonna be doing is.this way keeping your shoulders down your head.going over, but your head's not actually gonna move you're gonna place your hand.on the side of your forehead here on your temple area, and then you're just.gonna push into your hands so see my head's not moving you might see it move.just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here.on this side when you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds,.but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a.little uncomfortable maybe do thirty to forty percent of as hard as you think.you can push so pushing over to the side this is the motion I'm doing but I'm not.going anywhere I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on.each side instead of do them all on one side I just like to.alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break so.that 3 to 5 second hold maybe doing 5 on each side and that should really again.not only help strengthen the muscle it might help get you back into alignment a.little bit, and just get that neck pain out of there in general so there you.have it, those are my top 5 ways to reduce neck pain if you'd like to.purchase the sunny baton neck wrap hands-free, make sure and click up

xYFeFFzFftw,How to relieve neck pain with chin tucks? ,"(349, 451)",the exercises so one of my favorite exercises if youve seen some of my.videos for neck pains is chin tucks a chin tuck is really great because its.kind of a stretch and an exercise combined together but its a great way.to help get you back in good posture a lot of times with neck pain it comes.from people like this either at their computer or if theyre focusing on.something they really bring that head forward and that puts a lot of stress on.the neck causing pain so a chin tuck is super simple youve probably seen in.some of my videos where you use my finger as a target you dont have to do.that the great thing about a chin tuck is you can do it anywhere it is super easy.people might look at you a little funny when youre doing it but its easy to do.and so all youre doing is just like it sounds youre tucking your chin back and.in but its not down towards your chest so youre just taking your chin keeping.it level you want to keep your head level youre.not coming down or not coming up but youre just bringing your head in almost.you know if you have a wall or something behind you your chair behind you just.try and push your head into the wall or the chair and you see you.have lots of little chins right there and so you just want to hold that.position you might feel some tightness in the back you might feel some.tightness in the front as well and hold that for about 3 to 5 seconds and then.relax you can do those 5 times you can do them several times throughout the day.but again youre just taking that chin tucking it in and getting that youre.working the muscles and youre stretching the muscles at the same time.so its a really great exercise combination stretch to really kind of.reset everything and a lot of times just doing two or three you can.already feel that youre kind of back in that upright position your heads not.forward so much so I really like that exercise and then the last one is just a another,"hey everybody it's doctor Jo, and today I'm going to show you my top 5 ways to.reduce neck pain so let's get started so.so before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure and click on the.subscribe button down below, and you can always find me at askdoctorjocom.so we're gonna start off with some stretches, and then we'll move into the.exercises towards the end so the first stretch is an upper trap stretch a lot.of times when you have neck pain, those upper trap muscles really get tight, and.they'll cause more neck pain because they're they come up all the way up.those upper traps and connect to the neck area and then come down into the.shoulders so there's a couple different ways you can stretch the upper trap the.one I usually show you is where you're kind of sitting on your hand today I'm.going to show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some.shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable so do which one is more.comfortable for you this time you're just going to place your hand behind.your back so my hands just kind of in the middle of my lower back and my.elbows to the side right here so I'm keeping it close to my body this is the.side I want to stretch I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over.almost where I'm touching the top of my ear then I'm gonna gently pull my ear.over towards that side keeping my shoulder down low getting that stretch.right through here and you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds if you want.more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the.floor or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair, and that'll give.you that extra stretch in there 30 seconds doing that 3 times on each side.but remember with a stretch you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be.tension where it's that hurt so good feeling so then the next stretch is.going to be the levator scapulae stretch and that levator SCAP muscle is the one.that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades and so a lot of times when we're.holding stress, we overwork that muscle and it tightens and we kind of sit up.in this position, and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that.muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area.and can put a lot of pain and stress on that area so the way to stretch that one.out is this one's going to be a little bit differently, so.again you're going to use your arm but this time it's going to go up so you can.either just raise your arm, or I like to kind of put it back this way where my.elbow is kind of pointing up towards the ceiling so I'd be stretching this side.now so you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to.stretch and all this does is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down, and.so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch so again if this is.uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're.gonna get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that.shoulder blade down while you stretch the important part of this stretch is.you're not bringing your head down you're not bringing it over to the side.like for that upper trap stretch but you're bringing it down kind of an angle.where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite.knee so it's not down and then this way, it's turning your head kind of rotating.it and then coming down so elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up, and.over behind the head and then you're pulling down and you should feel that.stretch in that upper neck area, that levator scapulae muscle that goes.through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade so again.you're getting that nice stretch in there, holding it for 30 seconds, coming.back up, three times on each side because if you're having neck pain, even if the.neck pain is on one side, if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching.both sides because that's really just gonna loosen up that whole neck area so.another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use.heat or cold therapy, and the folks at bio med DB Design LLC sent me their.sunny Bay hands-free neck wrap and so what I really like about using heat.therapy and cold therapy is, the general rule if you're doing stretches and.exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles and then the cold.therapy afterwards so after you've gotten everything excited and working.use that cold therapy to cool it back down and so what I really like about.their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it, and you can use cold therapy.with it so you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can.put it in the freezer and cool it back down to.the cold therapy they've also changed their design a little bit you might have.seen me talk about these in the in the past, but they added an elastic.band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck.a little bit better and so once you get that band in you can really move around.you know I can bend my head I can turn to the side and it's not gonna fall off.so it makes it really functional where you can go about and do your things, but.you're still either getting that heat if you need it or if you need that cold.afterwards you can do that as well and so it's really nice also because.it's not plugged in, so you can move around with it on you know sometimes.with traditional heating pads you actually have to plug it in and stay in.one spot, but you don't have to do it with that they also come in different.sizes in different colors they have an extra-large version, so if you need a.little bit more length on the wrap around you have that option as well and.it also has that elastic band so it's really nice they use you know all.natural products on the inside so it's you know sometimes flax seeds sometimes.it's lavender, and so they use different kinds with that as well so if you're.interested in purchasing their product, make sure and click on the link up there.so now we're going to go into some exercises once you've gotten everything.stretched out, warm it up first, get it stretched out, then you want to go into.the exercises so one of my favorite exercises if you've seen some of my.videos for neck pains is chin tucks a chin tuck is really great because it's.kind of a stretch and an exercise combined together, but it's a great way.to help get you back in good posture a lot of times with neck pain it

have a wall or something behind you your chair behind you just.try and push your head into the wall or the chair and you see you.have lots of little chins right there and so you just want to hold that.position you might feel some tightness in the back, you might feel some.tightness in the front as well, and hold that for about 3 to 5 seconds, and then.relax you can do those 5 times you can do them several times throughout the day,.but again you're just taking that chin tucking it in, and getting that you're.working the muscles and you're stretching the muscles at the same time.so it's a really great exercise combination stretch to really kind of.reset everything and a lot of times just doing two or three you can.already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position your head's not.forward so much, so I really like that exercise and then the last one is just a another.super simple one that you can do all the time which is going to be.an isometric exercise a lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a.little bit out of alignment or need something like a pop, doing an isometric.exercise not only help strengthen it but sometimes it will help adjust your neck.as well so the one that I'm going to do for you today and and you can follow.along with me is a side bent isometric exercise but what isometric exercises.are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle, so.if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but.you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right.now so the motion you're gonna be doing is.this way keeping your shoulders down your head.going over, but your head's not actually gonna move you're gonna place your hand.on the side of your forehead here on your temple area, and then you're just.gonna push into your hands so see my head's not moving you might see it move.just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here.on this side when you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds,.but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a.little uncomfortable maybe do thirty to forty percent of as hard as you think.you can push so pushing over to the side this is the motion I'm doing but I'm not.going anywhere I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on.each side instead of do them all on one side I just like to.alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break so.that 3 to 5 second hold maybe doing 5 on each side and that should really again.not only help strengthen the muscle it might help get you back into alignment a.little bit, and just get that neck pain out of there in general so there you.have it,

xYFeFFzFftw,How to relieve neck pain with isometric side bends? ,"(451, 549)",forward so much so I really like that exercise and then the last one is just a another.super simple one that you can do all the time which is going to be.an isometric exercise a lot of time with isometric exercises if your neck is a.little bit out of alignment or need something like a pop doing an isometric.exercise not only help strengthen it but sometimes it will help adjust your neck.as well so the one that Im going to do for you today and and you can follow.along with me is a side bent isometric exercise but what isometric exercises.are is youre contracting the muscle but youre not really moving the muscle so.if youre having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but.youre not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right.now so the motion youre gonna be doing is.this way keeping your shoulders down your head.going over but your heads not actually gonna move youre gonna place your hand.on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then youre just.gonna push into your hands so see my heads not moving you might see it move.just a little bit but all Im doing is Im activating these muscles over here.on this side when you first do this just hold it for about three to five seconds.but dont push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a.little uncomfortable maybe do thirty to forty percent of as hard as you think.you can push so pushing over to the side this is the motion Im doing but Im not.going anywhere Im pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on.each side instead of do them all on one side I just like to.alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break so.that 3 to 5 second hold maybe doing 5 on each side and that should really again.not only help strengthen the muscle it might help get you back into alignment a.little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general so there you,"hey everybody it's doctor Jo, and today I'm going to show you my top 5 ways to.reduce neck pain so let's get started so.so before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure and click on the.subscribe button down below, and you can always find me at askdoctorjocom.so we're gonna start off with some stretches, and then we'll move into the.exercises towards the end so the first stretch is an upper trap stretch a lot.of times when you have neck pain, those upper trap muscles really get tight, and.they'll cause more neck pain because they're they come up all the way up.those upper traps and connect to the neck area and then come down into the.shoulders so there's a couple different ways you can stretch the upper trap the.one I usually show you is where you're kind of sitting on your hand today I'm.going to show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some.shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable so do which one is more.comfortable for you this time you're just going to place your hand behind.your back so my hands just kind of in the middle of my lower back and my.elbows to the side right here so I'm keeping it close to my body this is the.side I want to stretch I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over.almost where I'm touching the top of my ear then I'm gonna gently pull my ear.over towards that side keeping my shoulder down low getting that stretch.right through here and you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds if you want.more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the.floor or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair, and that'll give.you that extra stretch in there 30 seconds doing that 3 times on each side.but remember with a stretch you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be.tension where it's that hurt so good feeling so then the next stretch is.going to be the levator scapulae stretch and that levator SCAP muscle is the one.that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades and so a lot of times when we're.holding stress, we overwork that muscle and it tightens and we kind of sit up.in this position, and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that.muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area.and can put a lot of pain and stress on that area so the way to stretch that one.out is this one's going to be a little bit differently, so.again you're going to use your arm but this time it's going to go up so you can.either just raise your arm, or I like to kind of put it back this way where my.elbow is kind of pointing up towards the ceiling so I'd be stretching this side.now so you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to.stretch and all this does is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down, and.so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch so again if this is.uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're.gonna get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that.shoulder blade down while you stretch the important part of this stretch is.you're not bringing your head down you're not bringing it over to the side.like for that upper trap stretch but you're bringing it down kind of an angle.where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite.knee so it's not down and then this way, it's turning your head kind of rotating.it and then coming down so elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up, and.over behind the head and then you're pulling down and you should feel that.stretch in that upper neck area, that levator scapulae muscle that goes.through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade so again.you're getting that nice stretch in there, holding it for 30 seconds, coming.back up, three times on each side because if you're having neck pain, even if the.neck pain is on one side, if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching.both sides because that's really just gonna loosen up that whole neck area so.another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use.heat or cold therapy, and the folks at bio med DB Design LLC sent me their.sunny Bay hands-free neck wrap and so what I really like about using heat.therapy and cold therapy is, the general rule if you're doing stretches and.exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles and then the cold.therapy afterwards so after you've gotten everything excited and working.use that cold therapy to cool it back down and so what I really like about.their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it, and you can use cold therapy.with it so you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can.put it in the freezer and cool it back down to.the cold therapy they've also changed their design a little bit you might have.seen me talk about these in the in the past, but they added an elastic.band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck.a little bit better and so once you get that band in you can really move around.you know I can bend my head I can turn to the side and it's not gonna fall off.so it makes it really functional where you can go about and do your things, but.you're still either getting that heat if you need it or if you need that cold.afterwards you can do that as well and so it's really nice also because.it's not plugged in, so you can move around with it on you know sometimes.with traditional heating pads you actually have to plug it in and stay in.one spot, but you don't have to do it with that they also come in different.sizes in different colors they have an extra-large version, so if you need a.little bit more length on the wrap around you have that option as well and.it also has that elastic band so it's really nice they use you know all.natural products on the inside so it's you know sometimes flax seeds sometimes.it's lavender, and so they use different kinds with that as well so if you're.interested in purchasing their product, make sure and click on the link up there.so now we're going to go into some exercises once you've gotten everything.stretched out, warm it up first, get it stretched out, then you want to go into.the exercises so one of my favorite exercises if you've seen some of my.videos for neck pains is chin tucks a chin tuck is really great because it's.kind of a stretch and an exercise combined together, but it's a great way.to help get you back in good posture a lot of times with neck pain it comes.from people like this either at their computer or if they're focusing on.something they really bring that head forward, and that puts a lot of stress on.the neck causing pain so a chin tuck is super simple you've probably seen in.some of my videos where you use my finger as a target you don't have to do.that the great thing about a chin tuck is you can do it anywhere, it is super easy.people might look at you a little funny when you're doing it, but it's easy to do.and so all you're doing is just like it sounds you're tucking your chin back and.in, but it's not down towards your chest so you're just taking your chin keeping.it level, you want to keep your head level, you're.not coming down or not coming up, but you're just bringing your head in almost.you know if you have a wall or something behind you your chair behind you just.try and push your head into the wall or the chair and you see you.have lots of little chins right there and so you just want to hold that.position you might feel some tightness in the back, you might feel some.tightness in the front as well, and hold that for about 3 to 5 seconds, and then.relax you can do those 5 times you can do them several times throughout the day,.but again you're just taking that chin tucking it in, and getting that you're.working the muscles and you're stretching the muscles at the same time.so it's a really great exercise combination stretch to really kind of.reset everything and a lot of times just doing two or three you can.already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position your head's not.forward so much, so I really like that exercise and then the last one is just a another.super simple one that you can do all the time which is going to be.an isometric exercise a lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a.little bit out of alignment or need something like a pop, doing an isometric.exercise not only help strengthen it but sometimes it will help adjust

1PdyCdtkcGk,How can I do adaptive shortening or lengthening to help improve mobility in my shoulder?,"(147, 188)",respond to stress is placed on them so.for example if I am regularly going into.these full ranges of motion with my.shoulder my shoulder joint is going to.stay loose and mobile however lets say.I get up here and my shoulder starts to.hurt so because of that pain response I.dont ever go up and over that point.because I know thats going to.I know thats going to be painful so.what happens is your structures in your.shoulder actually undergo that adaptive.shortening that all of a sudden that.becomes my limitation that becomes my.range of motion right there just because.those structures are so painful so if we.can create some more space in there if.we can create this lengthening in there.to get back up into that full range of.motion a lot of times that can help you.out with your shoulder pain so the most,what's up guys hey Jared Beck strand.here doctor of physical therapy Conan.Titan calm do you suffer from shoulder.tightness or maybe limited shoulder.range of motion well today I wanted to.share with you eight of my favorite.stretches that you can do right at home.to help improve mobility in your.shoulder to stretch out that tightness.and hopefully help you guys to feel.better so let's get into it right now.[Music].all right you guys hey thank you so much.for joining me today here on tonin Titan.I'm excited to be able to share with you.a little bit about what I know about.this topic hopefully help you guys out.with some of the shoulder pain or the.limited mobility that you might feel.that you have in your shoulder if your.shoulder feels like it's stuck if it.feels like that range of motion is.limited I hope that I'll be able to.share some things with you guys today.that will help you out quick plug for.the channel if you have not done so.already go ahead and take this chance to.subscribe to tone and tighten here on.YouTube I try to share a lot of great.tips and advice some rehab tips even.some some home workouts some healthy.recipes my goal is to help you guys.become fitter healthier and even injury.free I hope you take the chance to.subscribe to this channel also if you do.like this video if you find the.information that I share useful I'd love.for you guys to hit that thumbs up.button down below and thank you so much.for that in advance okay so let's get.into it so your shoulder is the most.mobile joint in your body at least it.should be the most mobile joint in the.body it's capable of motion in three.different planes of motion we can go.forward and backwards we can go side to.side and then it can also rotate even up.here a little bit if you're limited in.one of those ranges of motion it can.actually affect other ranges of motion.as well it can cause pain it can pinch.on structures where it shouldn't be.pinching that can cause pain that can.cause issues such as impingement.tendonitis bursitis even rotator cuff.tears in very severe cases and so again.what I wanted to share with you guys.today.are about eight of my favorite stretches.to just improve mobility in your.shoulder to just create a little more.space to create a little more range of.motion one more point that I want to.make your shoulder will all the joints.in your body undergo what we call an.adaptive shortening or lengthening.meaning they're going to respond the the.ligaments the tendons the structures.they'll hold it together are going to.respond to stress is placed on them so.for example if I am regularly going into.these full ranges of motion with my.shoulder my shoulder joint is going to.stay loose and mobile however let's say.I get up here and my shoulder starts to.hurt so because of that pain response I.don't ever go up and over that point.because I know that's going to.I know that's going to be painful so.what happens is your structures in your.shoulder actually undergo that adaptive.shortening that all of a sudden that.becomes my limitation that becomes my.range of motion right there just because.those structures are so painful so if we.can create some more space in there if.we can create this lengthening in there.to get back up into that full range of.motion a lot of times that can help you.out with your shoulder pain so the most.common place that you're gonna feel pain.in your shoulder would be anterior and.superior meaning in the front and on the.top just given the arrangement of the.shoulder and the kind of the anatomy.behind it those places are a little more.susceptible to injury and therefore I.want to show you kind of more stretches.to stretch those out also these.stretches are going to go in order from.least intense to most intense so.hopefully you'll be able to tolerate at.least the first couple hopefully you'll.be able to tolerate all of them that.would be ideal if any of these cause.pain or discomfort beyond like a.stretching pain so I mean obviously.you're gonna feel it a little bit I want.you to feel like it's a good stretch but.I don't want it to feel pain and so I.tell people in my clinic I want you to.push to the point of pain but not in to.pain if it starts to become painful.you're pushing too hard so you need to.back off it a little bit or if it's.painful right from the get-go I want you.to just bail on it altogether and so try.to keep all of these stretches should be.as pain-free as possible so the first.stretch that I like we're gonna do a.wand extension stretch you're gonna get.a broom or a mop.in this video I'm gonna show you I've.got a golf club I feel like that's kind.of the most convenient and then we're.gonna take the shoulder again to stretch.that anterior shoulder out we need to.take it back behind us let's show you.how to do that you're gonna grab the.head of that golf club or whatever.you're using in your right hand your.left arm goes up high and then what.you're going to do is use your left arm.to push your right arm back behind you.as far as you can go should feel a.stretch right through the front of the.chest right in the front of the shoulder.he might fill it up through that biceps.a little bit and then you're just gonna.take it right back into that comfortable.position you're gonna hold it for 20.seconds again the stretch should be all.through the front of the shoulder 20.second hold you're going to.P that three times so that's stretch.number one stretch number two is going.to be an external rotator or a external.rotation stretch we're going to stretch.the tight internal rotators a lot of.times with posture if you're here all.day and if your shoulders are slumping.and rounding forward they're rounding.into what we call internal rotation I.want to come up and back here into this.external rotation position so what.you're gonna do is lay down on your back.still grab that same golf club broom mop.whatever you're gonna hold that in your.right hand.and then you're going to use your left.heart well so you're right right elbows.bent at a 90 degree angle your right.elbow is kept right into your side and.then you're gonna use your left arm to.push that right hand out towards the.side again just until a comfortable.stretch is felt through the front of.your shoulder now in this position you.should be able to get pretty close to 80.to 90 degrees of this external rotation.motion that means your forearm or the.back of your forearm should almost lay.down on the floor or whatever it is that.you're doing this exercise on if it's.not that's an indication that this would.be a good stretch for you.take it to where it's in a comfortable.position hold it there for 20 seconds.and then repeat that three times so.again that's going to stretch those.tight internal rotators if you happen to.be one of the I don't know called the.exception to the rule one of the fewer.that has the shoulder pain on the back.of your arm that could be indicative of.the external rotators being at play in.order to stretch those out we need to.get into an internal rotation stretch my.favorite one to show would be the.sleeper stretch what you're going to do.is lay down actually on your painful.side raise your arm up to about 90.degrees so your elbows out in front of.you with your elbow bent to a 90 degree.so here I'm laying on my left so if my.left shoulder was painful I'm gonna.bring it up into that 90 degree position.keep your elbow at at 90 use your right.hand on the back of your wrist to rotate.your forearm down towards the ground.into this what we call internal rotation.position now in this position you should.be able to get to about 70 to 80 degrees.of range of motion so not quite again.down to the table 90 degrees would be.all the way down to the table and if you.can't quite get.there that could be an indicator that.those external rotators are a little bit.tight you need to stretch into this.internal rotation range of motion okay.and so now let's get into what we would.call an overhead type motion we've done.a lot kind of down here in a safe.position for the shoulder again.progressing through intensity let's show.you some overhead stretches that I like.so the first one's going to be laying.down on your back you're still gonna.grab that same broom mop golf club.whatever it is that you're using and.then we're going to raise basically both.arms up and overhead now if my right.shoulder was painful I want that left.arm to do the lifting on this and so.your left arms doing the lifting your.right arm is holding on to that handle.and just kind of going along for the.right take it up as high as you can go.hold it as high as you can go pain free.hold it there for 20 seconds and then.repeat that one three times also and so.with that one your shoulder blades as.you're laying on the back on your back.it's a little easier to control but.because your shoulder blades are pinned.down to the ground.there's a little bit less range of.motion with that we'd hope to get up to.about a hundred and eighty degrees with.your shoulder blade pitch shoulder blade.pinned down you're only going to get up.to about a hundred and seventy or so you.need your shoulder blade to be free to.get through that last ten to fifteen.degrees of your range of motion so to do.that let's go ahead and try one standing.up now so I'm gonna grab my same golf.club my right hand if that was my.painful shoulder goes right up on top of.the club left hand grabs the handle I'm.gonna use my left hand to push my right.arm up as high as I can towards the.ceiling again the difference here is all.of a sudden my shoulder blade can rotate.up a little bit you should be able to.get a little more range of motion with.this however now we're in a gravity.dependent position it does cause a.little more stress on the shoulder joint.but if you can get to this one it's a.great stretch to stretch out again just.kind of the front of the shoulder you're.gonna feel that even under your armpit a.little bit take it to a pain-free.comfortable spot hold it for 20 seconds.and repeat that three times okay and so.again at the beginning of this video I.mentioned that that shoulder is a three.dimensional joint forward and backwards.let's get into some of the side to side.and so to do that same golf club I'm.gonna.the head of the golf club with my right.hand left hands on the handle I'm gonna.use that left hand to drive that right.hand out to my side and then all the way.up and over my head as high as I can.take it a lot of times if you don't get.into this motion regularly your inferior.capsule will get tight.that just means as you raise it up to.the side like this you might feel that a.little bit more aggressively in your.armpit that's where that stretch should.be if it's just painful to the top of.your shoulder I'd say give it up but if.you feel like it's pulling kind of.through that armpit even through that.lat muscle down there on the side that's.gonna be a good stretch for you you.guessed it three times twenty second.holds on that one.okay and so now let's get into my.doorway stretch as doorway stretches are.probably some of my favorite I'll show.you two right now and so similar to that.first one that I showed you with the.golf club that extension stretched back.behind you can replicate that on a.doorway let's talk about how you're.gonna come up to a doorway put both.hands low at about hip height on either.side of the door then take a step into.the doorway just until that comfortable.stretch is felt all through the front of.your chest in front of your shoulder.again that's one of my favorite for.anterior shoulder pain also one of my.favorite for like a biceps tendinitis.those are going to be good stretches for.that one three times twenty second holds.about 60 seconds of stretching a little.bit more aggressive let's get into a.doorway stretch high so now we're going.to take it up into maybe a little bit.more painful position but if you can.tolerate this it's a little bit more.effective stretch because we're going to.add a rotation component to it as well.so both forearms are up on the doorframe.now as I step into the door I'm getting.a pull through the front of my chest and.the front of my shoulders but then my.arm is also what we'd call externally.rotating so it's rotating kind of my.hand backwards as I'm up in that high.doorway position and so again three.times twenty second holds comfortable.stretch through the front of the chest.through the front of the shoulders is.what we're shooting forward with that.one okay and finally I've got one more.external rotation stretch so I'm just.going to show you right here this is.going to be up in this type of a.position and then we're gonna again.stretch the front of the chest and those.entry.rotators back into this position so to.do that I've got my golf club and what.I'm going to do is grab the handle on my.club and then just hold it behind my.back.and so you'll see I mean all I'm doing.is holding that golf club right here.behind my back now what I'm going to do.so my shoulder is at a ninety degree.from my body my elbow stays at a ninety.degree right here hand is on the handle.with that left hand I'm gonna reach over.and grab the bottom part of the club.down here and then hold on with my right.hand and I'm gonna pull my left hand.forward so right now I'm just pulling my.left hand towards you guys until I get.that external rotation in my shoulder so.the lateral view so I'm right here clubs.back behind me holding on with that.right hand left hand is going to grab.the golf club right down here as I pull.that bottom part of the club.you'll see what that's doing is actually.externally rotating it's taking my ship.my arm back into this position again.that's probably one of the more.aggressive stretches that I show people.but it's also one that is super.effective okay you guys so there you.have an eighth of my favorite stretches.for that shoulder joint and between all.of these that's probably what I.recommend the most often with you know.patients who come in with shoulder pain.who need to be stretched out that.collection or you know certain ones of.those exercises whatever that that.particular patient can tolerate make up.a lot of the home exercise programs that.I recommend for people so I hope that.something I showed you in there was.useful I hope that something in there.helps you out with some of the pain or.tightness that you might be experiencing.if it does you guys be sure to hit that.thumbs up button down below and

1PdyCdtkcGk,How can I do shoulder extension stretch to help improve mobility in my shoulder?,"(268, 296)",take it back behind us lets show you.how to do that youre gonna grab the.head of that golf club or whatever.youre using in your right hand your.left arm goes up high and then what.youre going to do is use your left arm.to push your right arm back behind you.as far as you can go should feel a.stretch right through the front of the.chest right in the front of the shoulder.he might fill it up through that biceps.a little bit and then youre just gonna.take it right back into that comfortable.position youre gonna hold it for 20.seconds again the stretch should be all.through the front of the shoulder 20.second hold youre going to.P that three times so thats stretch,what's up guys hey Jared Beck strand.here doctor of physical therapy Conan.Titan calm do you suffer from shoulder.tightness or maybe limited shoulder.range of motion well today I wanted to.share with you eight of my favorite.stretches that you can do right at home.to help improve mobility in your.shoulder to stretch out that tightness.and hopefully help you guys to feel.better so let's get into it right now.[Music].all right you guys hey thank you so much.for joining me today here on tonin Titan.I'm excited to be able to share with you.a little bit about what I know about.this topic hopefully help you guys out.with some of the shoulder pain or the.limited mobility that you might feel.that you have in your shoulder if your.shoulder feels like it's stuck if it.feels like that range of motion is.limited I hope that I'll be able to.share some things with you guys today.that will help you out quick plug for.the channel if you have not done so.already go ahead and take this chance to.subscribe to tone and tighten here on.YouTube I try to share a lot of great.tips and advice some rehab tips even.some some home workouts some healthy.recipes my goal is to help you guys.become fitter healthier and even injury.free I hope you take the chance to.subscribe to this channel also if you do.like this video if you find the.information that I share useful I'd love.for you guys to hit that thumbs up.button down below and thank you so much.for that in advance okay so let's get.into it so your shoulder is the most.mobile joint in your body at least it.should be the most mobile joint in the.body it's capable of motion in three.different planes of motion we can go.forward and backwards we can go side to.side and then it can also rotate even up.here a little bit if you're limited in.one of those ranges of motion it can.actually affect other ranges of motion.as well it can cause pain it can pinch.on structures where it shouldn't be.pinching that can cause pain that can.cause issues such as impingement.tendonitis bursitis even rotator cuff.tears in very severe cases and so again.what I wanted to share with you guys.today.are about eight of my favorite stretches.to just improve mobility in your.shoulder to just create a little more.space to create a little more range of.motion one more point that I want to.make your shoulder will all the joints.in your body undergo what we call an.adaptive shortening or lengthening.meaning they're going to respond the the.ligaments the tendons the structures.they'll hold it together are going to.respond to stress is placed on them so.for example if I am regularly going into.these full ranges of motion with my.shoulder my shoulder joint is going to.stay loose and mobile however let's say.I get up here and my shoulder starts to.hurt so because of that pain response I.don't ever go up and over that point.because I know that's going to.I know that's going to be painful so.what happens is your structures in your.shoulder actually undergo that adaptive.shortening that all of a sudden that.becomes my limitation that becomes my.range of motion right there just because.those structures are so painful so if we.can create some more space in there if.we can create this lengthening in there.to get back up into that full range of.motion a lot of times that can help you.out with your shoulder pain so the most.common place that you're gonna feel pain.in your shoulder would be anterior and.superior meaning in the front and on the.top just given the arrangement of the.shoulder and the kind of the anatomy.behind it those places are a little more.susceptible to injury and therefore I.want to show you kind of more stretches.to stretch those out also these.stretches are going to go in order from.least intense to most intense so.hopefully you'll be able to tolerate at.least the first couple hopefully you'll.be able to tolerate all of them that.would be ideal if any of these cause.pain or discomfort beyond like a.stretching pain so I mean obviously.you're gonna feel it a little bit I want.you to feel like it's a good stretch but.I don't want it to feel pain and so I.tell people in my clinic I want you to.push to the point of pain but not in to.pain if it starts to become painful.you're pushing too hard so you need to.back off it a little bit or if it's.painful right from the get-go I want you.to just bail on it altogether and so try.to keep all of these stretches should be.as pain-free as possible so the first.stretch that I like we're gonna do a.wand extension stretch you're gonna get.a broom or a mop.in this video I'm gonna show you I've.got a golf club I feel like that's kind.of the most convenient and then we're.gonna take the shoulder again to stretch.that anterior shoulder out we need to.take it back behind us let's show you.how to do that you're gonna grab the.head of that golf club or whatever.you're using in your right hand your.left arm goes up high and then what.you're going to do is use your left arm.to push your right arm back behind you.as far as you can go should feel a.stretch right through the front of the.chest right in the front of the shoulder.he might fill it up through that biceps.a little bit and then you're just gonna.take it right back into that comfortable.position you're gonna hold it for 20.seconds again the stretch should be all.through the front of the shoulder 20.second hold you're going to.P that three times so that's stretch.number one stretch number two is going.to be an external rotator or a external.rotation stretch we're going to stretch.the tight internal rotators a lot of.times with posture if you're here all.day and if your shoulders are slumping.and rounding forward they're rounding.into what we call internal rotation I.want to come up and back here into this.external rotation position so what.you're gonna do is lay down on your back.still grab that same golf club broom mop.whatever you're gonna hold that in your.right hand.and then you're going to use your left.heart well so you're right right elbows.bent at a 90 degree angle your right.elbow is kept right into your side and.then you're gonna use your left arm to.push that right hand out towards the.side again just until a comfortable.stretch is felt through the front of.your shoulder now in this position you.should be able to get pretty close to 80.to 90 degrees of this external rotation.motion that means your forearm or the.back of your forearm should almost lay.down on the floor or whatever it is that.you're doing this exercise on if it's.not that's an indication that this would.be a good stretch for you.take it to where it's in a comfortable.position hold it there for 20 seconds.and then repeat that three times so.again that's going to stretch those.tight internal rotators if you happen to.be one of the I don't know called the.exception to the rule one of the fewer.that has the shoulder pain on the back.of your arm that could be indicative of.the external rotators being at play in.order to stretch those out we need to.get into an internal rotation stretch my.favorite one to show would be the.sleeper stretch what you're going to do.is lay down actually on your painful.side raise your arm up to about 90.degrees so your elbows out in front of.you with your elbow bent to a 90 degree.so here I'm laying on my left so if my.left shoulder was painful I'm gonna.bring it up into that 90 degree position.keep your elbow at at 90 use your right.hand on the back of your wrist to rotate.your forearm down towards the ground.into this what we call internal rotation.position now in this position you should.be able to get to about 70 to 80 degrees.of range of motion so not quite again.down to the table 90 degrees would be.all the way down to the table and if you.can't quite get.there that could be an indicator that.those external rotators are a little bit.tight you need to stretch into this.internal rotation range of motion okay.and so now let's get into what we would.call an overhead type motion we've done.a lot kind of down here in a safe.position for the shoulder again.progressing through intensity let's show.you some overhead stretches that I like.so the first one's going to be laying.down on your back you're still gonna.grab that same broom mop golf club.whatever it is that you're using and.then we're going to raise basically both.arms up and overhead now if my right.shoulder was painful I want that left.arm to do the lifting on this and so.your left arms doing the lifting your.right arm is holding on to that handle.and just kind of going along for the.right take it up as high as you can go.hold it as high as you can go pain free.hold it there for 20 seconds and then.repeat that one three times also and so.with that one your shoulder blades as.you're laying on the back on your back.it's a little easier to control but.because your shoulder blades are pinned.down to the ground.there's a little bit less range of.motion with that we'd hope to get up to.about a hundred and eighty degrees with.your shoulder blade pitch shoulder blade.pinned down you're only going to get up.to about a hundred and seventy or so you.need your shoulder blade to be free to.get through that last ten to fifteen.degrees of your range of motion so to do.that let's go ahead and try one standing.up now so I'm gonna grab my same golf.club my right hand if that was my.painful shoulder goes right up on top of.the club left hand grabs the handle I'm.gonna use my left hand to push my right.arm up as high as I can towards the.ceiling again the difference here is all.of a sudden my shoulder blade can rotate.up a little bit you should be able to.get a little more range of motion with.this however now we're in a gravity.dependent position it does cause a.little more stress on the shoulder joint.but if you can get to this one it's a.great stretch to stretch out again just.kind of the front of the shoulder you're.gonna feel that even under your armpit a.little bit take it to a pain-free.comfortable spot hold it for 20 seconds.and repeat that three times okay and so.again at the beginning of this video I.mentioned that that shoulder is a three.dimensional joint forward and backwards.let's get into some of the side to side.and so to do that same golf club I'm.gonna.the head of the golf club with my right.hand left hands on the handle I'm gonna.use that left hand to drive that right.hand out to my side and then all the way.up and over my head as high as I can.take it a lot of times if you don't get.into this motion regularly your inferior.capsule will get tight.that just means as you raise it up to.the side like this you might feel that a.little bit more aggressively in your.armpit that's where that stretch should.be if it's just painful to the top of.your shoulder I'd say give it up but if.you feel like it's pulling kind of.through that armpit even through that.lat muscle down there on the side that's.gonna be a good stretch for you you.guessed it three times twenty second.holds on that one.okay and so now let's get into my.doorway stretch as doorway stretches are.probably some of my favorite I'll show.you two right now and so similar to that.first one that I showed you with the.golf club that extension stretched back.behind you can replicate that on a.doorway let's talk about how you're.gonna come up to a doorway put both.hands low at about hip height on either.side of the door then take a step into.the doorway just until that comfortable.stretch is felt all through the front of.your chest in front of your shoulder.again that's one of my favorite for.anterior shoulder pain also one of my.favorite for like a biceps tendinitis.those are going to be good stretches for.that one three times twenty second holds.about 60 seconds of stretching a little.bit more aggressive let's get into a.doorway stretch high so now we're going.to take it up into maybe a little bit.more painful position but if you can.tolerate this it's a little bit more.effective stretch because we're going to.add a rotation component to it as well.so both forearms are up on the doorframe.now as I step into the door I'm getting.a pull through the front of my chest and.the front of my shoulders but then my.arm is also what we'd call externally.rotating so it's rotating kind of my.hand backwards as I'm up in that high.doorway position and so again three.times twenty second holds comfortable.stretch through the front of the chest.through the front of the shoulders is.what we're shooting forward with that.one okay and finally I've got one more.external rotation stretch so I'm just.going to show you right here this is.going to be up in this type of a.position and then we're gonna again.stretch the front of the chest and those.entry.rotators back into this position so to.do that I've got my golf club and what.I'm going to do is grab the handle on my.club and then just hold it behind my.back.and so you'll see I mean all I'm doing.is holding that golf club right here.behind my back now what I'm going to do.so my shoulder is at a ninety degree.from my body my elbow stays at a ninety.degree right here hand is on the handle.with that left hand I'm gonna reach over.and grab the bottom part of the club.down here and then hold on with my right.hand and I'm gonna pull my left hand.forward so right now I'm just pulling my.left hand towards you guys until I get.that external rotation in my shoulder so.the lateral view so I'm right here clubs.back behind me holding on with that.right hand left hand is going to grab.the golf club right down here as I pull.that bottom part of the club.you'll see what that's doing is actually.externally rotating it's taking my ship.my arm back into this position again.that's probably one of the more.aggressive stretches that I show people.but it's also one that is super.effective okay you guys so there you.have an eighth of my favorite stretches.for that shoulder joint and between all.of these that's probably what I.recommend the most often with you know.patients who come in with shoulder pain.who need to be stretched out that.collection or you know certain ones of.those exercises whatever that that.particular patient can tolerate make up.a lot of the home exercise programs that.I recommend for people so I hope that.something I showed you in there was.useful I hope that something in there.helps you out with some of the pain or.tightness that you might be experiencing.if it does you guys be sure to hit that.thumbs up button down below and like.this video if you have any questions or.comments about anything that I've talked.about please

1PdyCdtkcGk,How can I do external rotator stretch to help improve mobility in my shoulder?,"(309, 357)",the tight internal rotators a lot of.times with posture if youre here all.day and if your shoulders are slumping.and rounding forward theyre rounding.into what we call internal rotation I.want to come up and back here into this.external rotation position so what.youre gonna do is lay down on your back.still grab that same golf club broom mop.whatever youre gonna hold that in your.right hand.and then youre going to use your left.heart well so youre right right elbows.bent at a 90 degree angle your right.elbow is kept right into your side and.then youre gonna use your left arm to.push that right hand out towards the.side again just until a comfortable.stretch is felt through the front of.your shoulder now in this position you.should be able to get pretty close to 80.to 90 degrees of this external rotation.motion that means your forearm or the.back of your forearm should almost lay.down on the floor or whatever it is that.youre doing this exercise on if its,what's up guys hey Jared Beck strand.here doctor of physical therapy Conan.Titan calm do you suffer from shoulder.tightness or maybe limited shoulder.range of motion well today I wanted to.share with you eight of my favorite.stretches that you can do right at home.to help improve mobility in your.shoulder to stretch out that tightness.and hopefully help you guys to feel.better so let's get into it right now.[Music].all right you guys hey thank you so much.for joining me today here on tonin Titan.I'm excited to be able to share with you.a little bit about what I know about.this topic hopefully help you guys out.with some of the shoulder pain or the.limited mobility that you might feel.that you have in your shoulder if your.shoulder feels like it's stuck if it.feels like that range of motion is.limited I hope that I'll be able to.share some things with you guys today.that will help you out quick plug for.the channel if you have not done so.already go ahead and take this chance to.subscribe to tone and tighten here on.YouTube I try to share a lot of great.tips and advice some rehab tips even.some some home workouts some healthy.recipes my goal is to help you guys.become fitter healthier and even injury.free I hope you take the chance to.subscribe to this channel also if you do.like this video if you find the.information that I share useful I'd love.for you guys to hit that thumbs up.button down below and thank you so much.for that in advance okay so let's get.into it so your shoulder is the most.mobile joint in your body at least it.should be the most mobile joint in the.body it's capable of motion in three.different planes of motion we can go.forward and backwards we can go side to.side and then it can also rotate even up.here a little bit if you're limited in.one of those ranges of motion it can.actually affect other ranges of motion.as well it can cause pain it can pinch.on structures where it shouldn't be.pinching that can cause pain that can.cause issues such as impingement.tendonitis bursitis even rotator cuff.tears in very severe cases and so again.what I wanted to share with you guys.today.are about eight of my favorite stretches.to just improve mobility in your.shoulder to just create a little more.space to create a little more range of.motion one more point that I want to.make your shoulder will all the joints.in your body undergo what we call an.adaptive shortening or lengthening.meaning they're going to respond the the.ligaments the tendons the structures.they'll hold it together are going to.respond to stress is placed on them so.for example if I am regularly going into.these full ranges of motion with my.shoulder my shoulder joint is going to.stay loose and mobile however let's say.I get up here and my shoulder starts to.hurt so because of that pain response I.don't ever go up and over that point.because I know that's going to.I know that's going to be painful so.what happens is your structures in your.shoulder actually undergo that adaptive.shortening that all of a sudden that.becomes my limitation that becomes my.range of motion right there just because.those structures are so painful so if we.can create some more space in there if.we can create this lengthening in there.to get back up into that full range of.motion a lot of times that can help you.out with your shoulder pain so the most.common place that you're gonna feel pain.in your shoulder would be anterior and.superior meaning in the front and on the.top just given the arrangement of the.shoulder and the kind of the anatomy.behind it those places are a little more.susceptible to injury and therefore I.want to show you kind of more stretches.to stretch those out also these.stretches are going to go in order from.least intense to most intense so.hopefully you'll be able to tolerate at.least the first couple hopefully you'll.be able to tolerate all of them that.would be ideal if any of these cause.pain or discomfort beyond like a.stretching pain so I mean obviously.you're gonna feel it a little bit I want.you to feel like it's a good stretch but.I don't want it to feel pain and so I.tell people in my clinic I want you to.push to the point of pain but not in to.pain if it starts to become painful.you're pushing too hard so you need to.back off it a little bit or if it's.painful right from the get-go I want you.to just bail on it altogether and so try.to keep all of these stretches should be.as pain-free as possible so the first.stretch that I like we're gonna do a.wand extension stretch you're gonna get.a broom or a mop.in this video I'm gonna show you I've.got a golf club I feel like that's kind.of the most convenient and then we're.gonna take the shoulder again to stretch.that anterior shoulder out we need to.take it back behind us let's show you.how to do that you're gonna grab the.head of that golf club or whatever.you're using in your right hand your.left arm goes up high and then what.you're going to do is use your left arm.to push your right arm back behind you.as far as you can go should feel a.stretch right through the front of the.chest right in the front of the shoulder.he might fill it up through that biceps.a little bit and then you're just gonna.take it right back into that comfortable.position you're gonna hold it for 20.seconds again the stretch should be all.through the front of the shoulder 20.second hold you're going to.P that three times so that's stretch.number one stretch number two is going.to be an external rotator or a external.rotation stretch we're going to stretch.the tight internal rotators a lot of.times with posture if you're here all.day and if your shoulders are slumping.and rounding forward they're rounding.into what we call internal rotation I.want to come up and back here into this.external rotation position so what.you're gonna do is lay down on your back.still grab that same golf club broom mop.whatever you're gonna hold that in your.right hand.and then you're going to use your left.heart well so you're right right elbows.bent at a 90 degree angle your right.elbow is kept right into your side and.then you're gonna use your left arm to.push that right hand out towards the.side again just until a comfortable.stretch is felt through the front of.your shoulder now in this position you.should be able to get pretty close to 80.to 90 degrees of this external rotation.motion that means your forearm or the.back of your forearm should almost lay.down on the floor or whatever it is that.you're doing this exercise on if it's.not that's an indication that this would.be a good stretch for you.take it to where it's in a comfortable.position hold it there for 20 seconds.and then repeat that three times so.again that's going to stretch those.tight internal rotators if you happen to.be one of the I don't know called the.exception to the rule one of the fewer.that has the shoulder pain on the back.of your arm that could be indicative of.the external rotators being at play in.order to stretch those out we need to.get into an internal rotation stretch my.favorite one to show would be the.sleeper stretch what you're going to do.is lay down actually on your painful.side raise your arm up to about 90.degrees so your elbows out in front of.you with your elbow bent to a 90 degree.so here I'm laying on my left so if my.left shoulder was painful I'm gonna.bring it up into that 90 degree position.keep your elbow at at 90 use your right.hand on the back of your wrist to rotate.your forearm down towards the ground.into this what we call internal rotation.position now in this position you should.be able to get to about 70 to 80 degrees.of range of motion so not quite again.down to the table 90 degrees would be.all the way down to the table and if you.can't quite get.there that could be an indicator that.those external rotators are a little bit.tight you need to stretch into this.internal rotation range of motion okay.and so now let's get into what we would.call an overhead type motion we've done.a lot kind of down here in a safe.position for the shoulder again.progressing through intensity let's show.you some overhead stretches that I like.so the first one's going to be laying.down on your back you're still gonna.grab that same broom mop golf club.whatever it is that you're using and.then we're going to raise basically both.arms up and overhead now if my right.shoulder was painful I want that left.arm to do the lifting on this and so.your left arms doing the lifting your.right arm is holding on to that handle.and just kind of going along for the.right take it up as high as you can go.hold it as high as you can go pain free.hold it there for 20 seconds and then.repeat that one three times also and so.with that one your shoulder blades as.you're laying on the back on your back.it's a little easier to control but.because your shoulder blades are pinned.down to the ground.there's a little bit less range of.motion with that we'd hope to get up to.about a hundred and eighty degrees with.your shoulder blade pitch shoulder blade.pinned down you're only going to get up.to about a hundred and seventy or so you.need your shoulder blade to be free to.get through that last ten to fifteen.degrees of your range of motion so to do.that let's go ahead and try one standing.up now so I'm gonna grab my same golf.club my right hand if that was my.painful shoulder goes right up on top of.the club left hand grabs the handle I'm.gonna use my left hand to push my right.arm up as high as I can towards the.ceiling again the difference here is all.of a sudden my shoulder blade can rotate.up a little bit you should be able to.get a little more range of motion with.this however now we're in a gravity.dependent position it does cause a.little more stress on the shoulder joint.but if you can get to this one it's a.great stretch to stretch out again just.kind of the front of the shoulder you're.gonna feel that even under your armpit a.little bit take it to a pain-free.comfortable spot hold it for 20 seconds.and repeat that three times okay and so.again at the beginning of this video I.mentioned that that shoulder is a three.dimensional joint forward and backwards.let's get into some of the side to side.and so to do that same golf club I'm.gonna.the head of the golf club with my right.hand left hands on the handle I'm gonna.use that left hand to drive that right.hand out to my side and then all the way.up and over my head as high as I can.take it a lot of times if you don't get.into this motion regularly your inferior.capsule will get tight.that just means as you raise it up to.the side like this you might feel that a.little bit more aggressively in your.armpit that's where that stretch should.be if it's just painful to the top of.your shoulder I'd say give it up but if.you feel like it's pulling kind of.through that armpit even through that.lat muscle down there on the side that's.gonna be a good stretch for you you.guessed it three times twenty second.holds on that one.okay and so now let's get into my.doorway stretch as doorway stretches are.probably some of my favorite I'll show.you two right now and so similar to that.first one that I showed you with the.golf club that extension stretched back.behind you can replicate that on a.doorway let's talk about how you're.gonna come up to a doorway put both.hands low at about hip height on either.side of the door then take a step into.the doorway just until that comfortable.stretch is felt all through the front of.your chest in front of your shoulder.again that's one of my favorite for.anterior shoulder pain also one of my.favorite for like a biceps tendinitis.those are going to be good stretches for.that one three times twenty second holds.about 60 seconds of stretching a little.bit more aggressive let's get into a.doorway stretch high so now we're going.to take it up into maybe a little bit.more painful position but if you can.tolerate this it's a little bit more.effective stretch because we're going to.add a rotation component to it as well.so both forearms are up on the doorframe.now as I step into the door I'm getting.a pull through the front of my chest and.the front of my shoulders but then my.arm is also what we'd call externally.rotating so it's rotating kind of my.hand backwards as I'm up in that high.doorway position and so again three.times twenty second holds comfortable.stretch through the front of the chest.through the front of the shoulders is.what we're shooting forward with that.one okay and finally I've got one more.external rotation stretch so I'm just.going to show you right here this is.going to be up in this type of a.position and then we're gonna again.stretch the front of the chest and those.entry.rotators back into this position so to.do that I've got my golf club and what.I'm going to do is grab the handle on my.club and then just hold it behind my.back.and so you'll see I mean all I'm doing.is holding that golf club right here.behind my back now what I'm going to do.so my shoulder is at a ninety degree.from my body my elbow stays at a ninety.degree right here hand is on the handle.with that left hand I'm gonna reach over.and grab the bottom part of the club.down here and then hold on with my right.hand and I'm gonna pull my left hand.forward so right now I'm just pulling my.left hand towards you guys until I get.that external rotation in my shoulder so.the lateral view so I'm right here clubs.back behind me holding on with that.right hand left hand is going to grab.the golf club right down here as I pull.that bottom part of the club.you'll see what that's doing is actually.externally rotating it's taking my ship.my arm back into this position again.that's probably one of the more.aggressive stretches that I show people.but it's also one that is super.effective okay you guys so there you.have an eighth of my favorite stretches.for that shoulder joint and between all.of these that's probably what I.recommend the most often with you know.patients who come in with shoulder pain.who need to be stretched out that.collection or you know certain ones of.those exercises whatever that that.particular patient can tolerate make up.a lot of the home exercise programs that.I recommend for people so I hope that.something I showed you in there was.useful I hope that something in there.helps you out with some of the pain or.tightness that you might be experiencing.if it does you guys be sure to hit that.thumbs up button down below and like.this video if you have any questions or.comments about anything that I've talked.about please leave those down below and.I'll get to those just as soon as I can.one more plug for the channel be

1PdyCdtkcGk,How can I do sleeper internal rotation stretch to help improve mobility in my shoulder?,"(398, 424)",degrees so your elbows out in front of.you with your elbow bent to a 90 degree.so here Im laying on my left so if my.left shoulder was painful Im gonna.bring it up into that 90 degree position.keep your elbow at at 90 use your right.hand on the back of your wrist to rotate.your forearm down towards the ground.into this what we call internal rotation.position now in this position you should.be able to get to about 70 to 80 degrees.of range of motion so not quite again.down to the table 90 degrees would be,what's up guys hey Jared Beck strand.here doctor of physical therapy Conan.Titan calm do you suffer from shoulder.tightness or maybe limited shoulder.range of motion well today I wanted to.share with you eight of my favorite.stretches that you can do right at home.to help improve mobility in your.shoulder to stretch out that tightness.and hopefully help you guys to feel.better so let's get into it right now.[Music].all right you guys hey thank you so much.for joining me today here on tonin Titan.I'm excited to be able to share with you.a little bit about what I know about.this topic hopefully help you guys out.with some of the shoulder pain or the.limited mobility that you might feel.that you have in your shoulder if your.shoulder feels like it's stuck if it.feels like that range of motion is.limited I hope that I'll be able to.share some things with you guys today.that will help you out quick plug for.the channel if you have not done so.already go ahead and take this chance to.subscribe to tone and tighten here on.YouTube I try to share a lot of great.tips and advice some rehab tips even.some some home workouts some healthy.recipes my goal is to help you guys.become fitter healthier and even injury.free I hope you take the chance to.subscribe to this channel also if you do.like this video if you find the.information that I share useful I'd love.for you guys to hit that thumbs up.button down below and thank you so much.for that in advance okay so let's get.into it so your shoulder is the most.mobile joint in your body at least it.should be the most mobile joint in the.body it's capable of motion in three.different planes of motion we can go.forward and backwards we can go side to.side and then it can also rotate even up.here a little bit if you're limited in.one of those ranges of motion it can.actually affect other ranges of motion.as well it can cause pain it can pinch.on structures where it shouldn't be.pinching that can cause pain that can.cause issues such as impingement.tendonitis bursitis even rotator cuff.tears in very severe cases and so again.what I wanted to share with you guys.today.are about eight of my favorite stretches.to just improve mobility in your.shoulder to just create a little more.space to create a little more range of.motion one more point that I want to.make your shoulder will all the joints.in your body undergo what we call an.adaptive shortening or lengthening.meaning they're going to respond the the.ligaments the tendons the structures.they'll hold it together are going to.respond to stress is placed on them so.for example if I am regularly going into.these full ranges of motion with my.shoulder my shoulder joint is going to.stay loose and mobile however let's say.I get up here and my shoulder starts to.hurt so because of that pain response I.don't ever go up and over that point.because I know that's going to.I know that's going to be painful so.what happens is your structures in your.shoulder actually undergo that adaptive.shortening that all of a sudden that.becomes my limitation that becomes my.range of motion right there just because.those structures are so painful so if we.can create some more space in there if.we can create this lengthening in there.to get back up into that full range of.motion a lot of times that can help you.out with your shoulder pain so the most.common place that you're gonna feel pain.in your shoulder would be anterior and.superior meaning in the front and on the.top just given the arrangement of the.shoulder and the kind of the anatomy.behind it those places are a little more.susceptible to injury and therefore I.want to show you kind of more stretches.to stretch those out also these.stretches are going to go in order from.least intense to most intense so.hopefully you'll be able to tolerate at.least the first couple hopefully you'll.be able to tolerate all of them that.would be ideal if any of these cause.pain or discomfort beyond like a.stretching pain so I mean obviously.you're gonna feel it a little bit I want.you to feel like it's a good stretch but.I don't want it to feel pain and so I.tell people in my clinic I want you to.push to the point of pain but not in to.pain if it starts to become painful.you're pushing too hard so you need to.back off it a little bit or if it's.painful right from the get-go I want you.to just bail on it altogether and so try.to keep all of these stretches should be.as pain-free as possible so the first.stretch that I like we're gonna do a.wand extension stretch you're gonna get.a broom or a mop.in this video I'm gonna show you I've.got a golf club I feel like that's kind.of the most convenient and then we're.gonna take the shoulder again to stretch.that anterior shoulder out we need to.take it back behind us let's show you.how to do that you're gonna grab the.head of that golf club or whatever.you're using in your right hand your.left arm goes up high and then what.you're going to do is use your left arm.to push your right arm back behind you.as far as you can go should feel a.stretch right through the front of the.chest right in the front of the shoulder.he might fill it up through that biceps.a little bit and then you're just gonna.take it right back into that comfortable.position you're gonna hold it for 20.seconds again the stretch should be all.through the front of the shoulder 20.second hold you're going to.P that three times so that's stretch.number one stretch number two is going.to be an external rotator or a external.rotation stretch we're going to stretch.the tight internal rotators a lot of.times with posture if you're here all.day and if your shoulders are slumping.and rounding forward they're rounding.into what we call internal rotation I.want to come up and back here into this.external rotation position so what.you're gonna do is lay down on your back.still grab that same golf club broom mop.whatever you're gonna hold that in your.right hand.and then you're going to use your left.heart well so you're right right elbows.bent at a 90 degree angle your right.elbow is kept right into your side and.then you're gonna use your left arm to.push that right hand out towards the.side again just until a comfortable.stretch is felt through the front of.your shoulder now in this position you.should be able to get pretty close to 80.to 90 degrees of this external rotation.motion that means your forearm or the.back of your forearm should almost lay.down on the floor or whatever it is that.you're doing this exercise on if it's.not that's an indication that this would.be a good stretch for you.take it to where it's in a comfortable.position hold it there for 20 seconds.and then repeat that three times so.again that's going to stretch those.tight internal rotators if you happen to.be one of the I don't know called the.exception to the rule one of the fewer.that has the shoulder pain on the back.of your arm that could be indicative of.the external rotators being at play in.order to stretch those out we need to.get into an internal rotation stretch my.favorite one to show would be the.sleeper stretch what you're going to do.is lay down actually on your painful.side raise your arm up to about 90.degrees so your elbows out in front of.you with your elbow bent to a 90 degree.so here I'm laying on my left so if my.left shoulder was painful I'm gonna.bring it up into that 90 degree position.keep your elbow at at 90 use your right.hand on the back of your wrist to rotate.your forearm down towards the ground.into this what we call internal rotation.position now in this position you should.be able to get to about 70 to 80 degrees.of range of motion so not quite again.down to the table 90 degrees would be.all the way down to the table and if you.can't quite get.there that could be an indicator that.those external rotators are a little bit.tight you need to stretch into this.internal rotation range of motion okay.and so now let's get into what we would.call an overhead type motion we've done.a lot kind of down here in a safe.position for the shoulder again.progressing through intensity let's show.you some overhead stretches that I like.so the first one's going to be laying.down on your back you're still gonna.grab that same broom mop golf club.whatever it is that you're using and.then we're going to raise basically both.arms up and overhead now if my right.shoulder was painful I want that left.arm to do the lifting on this and so.your left arms doing the lifting your.right arm is holding on to that handle.and just kind of going along for the.right take it up as high as you can go.hold it as high as you can go pain free.hold it there for 20 seconds and then.repeat that one three times also and so.with that one your shoulder blades as.you're laying on the back on your back.it's a little easier to control but.because your shoulder blades are pinned.down to the ground.there's a little bit less range of.motion with that we'd hope to get up to.about a hundred and eighty degrees with.your shoulder blade pitch shoulder blade.pinned down you're only going to get up.to about a hundred and seventy or so you.need your shoulder blade to be free to.get through that last ten to fifteen.degrees of your range of motion so to do.that let's go ahead and try one standing.up now so I'm gonna grab my same golf.club my right hand if that was my.painful shoulder goes right up on top of.the club left hand grabs the handle I'm.gonna use my left hand to push my right.arm up as high as I can towards the.ceiling again the difference here is all.of a sudden my shoulder blade can rotate.up a little bit you should be able to.get a little more range of motion with.this however now we're in a gravity.dependent position it does cause a.little more stress on the shoulder joint.but if you can get to this one it's a.great stretch to stretch out again just.kind of the front of the shoulder you're.gonna feel that even under your armpit a.little bit take it to a pain-free.comfortable spot hold it for 20 seconds.and repeat that three times okay and so.again at the beginning of this video I.mentioned that that shoulder is a three.dimensional joint forward and backwards.let's get into some of the side to side.and so to do that same golf club I'm.gonna.the head of the golf club with my right.hand left hands on the handle I'm gonna.use that left hand to drive that right.hand out to my side and then all the way.up and over my head as high as I can.take it a lot of times if you don't get.into this motion regularly your inferior.capsule will get tight.that just means as you raise it up to.the side like this you might feel that a.little bit more aggressively in your.armpit that's where that stretch should.be if it's just painful to the top of.your shoulder I'd say give it up but if.you feel like it's pulling kind of.through that armpit even through that.lat muscle down there on the side that's.gonna be a good stretch for you you.guessed it three times twenty second.holds on that one.okay and so now let's get into my.doorway stretch as doorway stretches are.probably some of my favorite I'll show.you two right now and so similar to that.first one that I showed you with the.golf club that extension stretched back.behind you can replicate that on a.doorway let's talk about how you're.gonna come up to a doorway put both.hands low at about hip height on either.side of the door then take a step into.the doorway just until that comfortable.stretch is felt all through the front of.your chest in front of your shoulder.again that's one of my favorite for.anterior shoulder pain also one of my.favorite for like a biceps tendinitis.those are going to be good stretches for.that one three times twenty second holds.about 60 seconds of stretching a little.bit more aggressive let's get into a.doorway stretch high so now we're going.to take it up into maybe a little bit.more painful position but if you can.tolerate this it's a little bit more.effective stretch because we're going to.add a rotation component to it as well.so both forearms are up on the doorframe.now as I step into the door I'm getting.a pull through the front of my chest and.the front of my shoulders but then my.arm is also what we'd call externally.rotating so it's rotating kind of my.hand backwards as I'm up in that high.doorway position and so again three.times twenty second holds comfortable.stretch through the front of the chest.through the front of the shoulders is.what we're shooting forward with that.one okay and finally I've got one more.external rotation stretch so I'm just.going to show you right here this is.going to be up in this type of a.position and then we're gonna again.stretch the front of the chest and those.entry.rotators back into this position so to.do that I've got my golf club and what.I'm going to do is grab the handle on my.club and then just hold it behind my.back.and so you'll see I mean all I'm doing.is holding that golf club right here.behind my back now what I'm going to do.so my shoulder is at a ninety degree.from my body my elbow stays at a ninety.degree right here hand is on the handle.with that left hand I'm gonna reach over.and grab the bottom part of the club.down here and then hold on with my right.hand and I'm gonna pull my left hand.forward so right now I'm just pulling my.left hand towards you guys until I get.that external rotation in my shoulder so.the lateral view so I'm right here clubs.back behind me holding on with that.right hand left hand is going to grab.the golf club right down here as I pull.that bottom part of the club.you'll see what that's doing is actually.externally rotating it's taking my ship.my arm back into this position again.that's probably one of the more.aggressive stretches that I show people.but it's also one that is super.effective okay you guys so there you.have an eighth of my favorite stretches.for that shoulder joint and between all.of these that's probably what I.recommend the most often with you know.patients who come in with shoulder pain.who need to be stretched out that.collection or you know certain ones of.those exercises whatever that that.particular patient can tolerate make up.a lot of the home exercise programs that.I recommend for people so I hope that.something I showed you in there was.useful I hope that something in there.helps you out with some of the pain or.tightness that you might be experiencing.if it does you guys be sure to hit that.thumbs up button down below and like.this video if you have any questions or.comments about anything that I've talked.about please leave those down below and.I'll get to those just as soon as I can.one more plug for the channel be sure to.hit that subscribe button down there and.I'd love to see you back here for more.tone and

1PdyCdtkcGk,How can I do overhead flexion stretch to help improve mobility in my shoulder?,"(456, 481)",whatever it is that youre using and.then were going to raise basically both.arms up and overhead now if my right.shoulder was painful I want that left.arm to do the lifting on this and so.your left arms doing the lifting your.right arm is holding on to that handle.and just kind of going along for the.right take it up as high as you can go.hold it as high as you can go pain free.hold it there for 20 seconds and then.repeat that one three times also and so.with that one your shoulder blades as,what's up guys hey Jared Beck strand.here doctor of physical therapy Conan.Titan calm do you suffer from shoulder.tightness or maybe limited shoulder.range of motion well today I wanted to.share with you eight of my favorite.stretches that you can do right at home.to help improve mobility in your.shoulder to stretch out that tightness.and hopefully help you guys to feel.better so let's get into it right now.[Music].all right you guys hey thank you so much.for joining me today here on tonin Titan.I'm excited to be able to share with you.a little bit about what I know about.this topic hopefully help you guys out.with some of the shoulder pain or the.limited mobility that you might feel.that you have in your shoulder if your.shoulder feels like it's stuck if it.feels like that range of motion is.limited I hope that I'll be able to.share some things with you guys today.that will help you out quick plug for.the channel if you have not done so.already go ahead and take this chance to.subscribe to tone and tighten here on.YouTube I try to share a lot of great.tips and advice some rehab tips even.some some home workouts some healthy.recipes my goal is to help you guys.become fitter healthier and even injury.free I hope you take the chance to.subscribe to this channel also if you do.like this video if you find the.information that I share useful I'd love.for you guys to hit that thumbs up.button down below and thank you so much.for that in advance okay so let's get.into it so your shoulder is the most.mobile joint in your body at least it.should be the most mobile joint in the.body it's capable of motion in three.different planes of motion we can go.forward and backwards we can go side to.side and then it can also rotate even up.here a little bit if you're limited in.one of those ranges of motion it can.actually affect other ranges of motion.as well it can cause pain it can pinch.on structures where it shouldn't be.pinching that can cause pain that can.cause issues such as impingement.tendonitis bursitis even rotator cuff.tears in very severe cases and so again.what I wanted to share with you guys.today.are about eight of my favorite stretches.to just improve mobility in your.shoulder to just create a little more.space to create a little more range of.motion one more point that I want to.make your shoulder will all the joints.in your body undergo what we call an.adaptive shortening or lengthening.meaning they're going to respond the the.ligaments the tendons the structures.they'll hold it together are going to.respond to stress is placed on them so.for example if I am regularly going into.these full ranges of motion with my.shoulder my shoulder joint is going to.stay loose and mobile however let's say.I get up here and my shoulder starts to.hurt so because of that pain response I.don't ever go up and over that point.because I know that's going to.I know that's going to be painful so.what happens is your structures in your.shoulder actually undergo that adaptive.shortening that all of a sudden that.becomes my limitation that becomes my.range of motion right there just because.those structures are so painful so if we.can create some more space in there if.we can create this lengthening in there.to get back up into that full range of.motion a lot of times that can help you.out with your shoulder pain so the most.common place that you're gonna feel pain.in your shoulder would be anterior and.superior meaning in the front and on the.top just given the arrangement of the.shoulder and the kind of the anatomy.behind it those places are a little more.susceptible to injury and therefore I.want to show you kind of more stretches.to stretch those out also these.stretches are going to go in order from.least intense to most intense so.hopefully you'll be able to tolerate at.least the first couple hopefully you'll.be able to tolerate all of them that.would be ideal if any of these cause.pain or discomfort beyond like a.stretching pain so I mean obviously.you're gonna feel it a little bit I want.you to feel like it's a good stretch but.I don't want it to feel pain and so I.tell people in my clinic I want you to.push to the point of pain but not in to.pain if it starts to become painful.you're pushing too hard so you need to.back off it a little bit or if it's.painful right from the get-go I want you.to just bail on it altogether and so try.to keep all of these stretches should be.as pain-free as possible so the first.stretch that I like we're gonna do a.wand extension stretch you're gonna get.a broom or a mop.in this video I'm gonna show you I've.got a golf club I feel like that's kind.of the most convenient and then we're.gonna take the shoulder again to stretch.that anterior shoulder out we need to.take it back behind us let's show you.how to do that you're gonna grab the.head of that golf club or whatever.you're using in your right hand your.left arm goes up high and then what.you're going to do is use your left arm.to push your right arm back behind you.as far as you can go should feel a.stretch right through the front of the.chest right in the front of the shoulder.he might fill it up through that biceps.a little bit and then you're just gonna.take it right back into that comfortable.position you're gonna hold it for 20.seconds again the stretch should be all.through the front of the shoulder 20.second hold you're going to.P that three times so that's stretch.number one stretch number two is going.to be an external rotator or a external.rotation stretch we're going to stretch.the tight internal rotators a lot of.times with posture if you're here all.day and if your shoulders are slumping.and rounding forward they're rounding.into what we call internal rotation I.want to come up and back here into this.external rotation position so what.you're gonna do is lay down on your back.still grab that same golf club broom mop.whatever you're gonna hold that in your.right hand.and then you're going to use your left.heart well so you're right right elbows.bent at a 90 degree angle your right.elbow is kept right into your side and.then you're gonna use your left arm to.push that right hand out towards the.side again just until a comfortable.stretch is felt through the front of.your shoulder now in this position you.should be able to get pretty close to 80.to 90 degrees of this external rotation.motion that means your forearm or the.back of your forearm should almost lay.down on the floor or whatever it is that.you're doing this exercise on if it's.not that's an indication that this would.be a good stretch for you.take it to where it's in a comfortable.position hold it there for 20 seconds.and then repeat that three times so.again that's going to stretch those.tight internal rotators if you happen to.be one of the I don't know called the.exception to the rule one of the fewer.that has the shoulder pain on the back.of your arm that could be indicative of.the external rotators being at play in.order to stretch those out we need to.get into an internal rotation stretch my.favorite one to show would be the.sleeper stretch what you're going to do.is lay down actually on your painful.side raise your arm up to about 90.degrees so your elbows out in front of.you with your elbow bent to a 90 degree.so here I'm laying on my left so if my.left shoulder was painful I'm gonna.bring it up into that 90 degree position.keep your elbow at at 90 use your right.hand on the back of your wrist to rotate.your forearm down towards the ground.into this what we call internal rotation.position now in this position you should.be able to get to about 70 to 80 degrees.of range of motion so not quite again.down to the table 90 degrees would be.all the way down to the table and if you.can't quite get.there that could be an indicator that.those external rotators are a little bit.tight you need to stretch into this.internal rotation range of motion okay.and so now let's get into what we would.call an overhead type motion we've done.a lot kind of down here in a safe.position for the shoulder again.progressing through intensity let's show.you some overhead stretches that I like.so the first one's going to be laying.down on your back you're still gonna.grab that same broom mop golf club.whatever it is that you're using and.then we're going to raise basically both.arms up and overhead now if my right.shoulder was painful I want that left.arm to do the lifting on this and so.your left arms doing the lifting your.right arm is holding on to that handle.and just kind of going along for the.right take it up as high as you can go.hold it as high as you can go pain free.hold it there for 20 seconds and then.repeat that one three times also and so.with that one your shoulder blades as.you're laying on the back on your back.it's a little easier to control but.because your shoulder blades are pinned.down to the ground.there's a little bit less range of.motion with that we'd hope to get up to.about a hundred and eighty degrees with.your shoulder blade pitch shoulder blade.pinned down you're only going to get up.to about a hundred and seventy or so you.need your shoulder blade to be free to.get through that last ten to fifteen.degrees of your range of motion so to do.that let's go ahead and try one standing.up now so I'm gonna grab my same golf.club my right hand if that was my.painful shoulder goes right up on top of.the club left hand grabs the handle I'm.gonna use my left hand to push my right.arm up as high as I can towards the.ceiling again the difference here is all.of a sudden my shoulder blade can rotate.up a little bit you should be able to.get a little more range of motion with.this however now we're in a gravity.dependent position it does cause a.little more stress on the shoulder joint.but if you can get to this one it's a.great stretch to stretch out again just.kind of the front of the shoulder you're.gonna feel that even under your armpit a.little bit take it to a pain-free.comfortable spot hold it for 20 seconds.and repeat that three times okay and so.again at the beginning of this video I.mentioned that that shoulder is a three.dimensional joint forward and backwards.let's get into some of the side to side.and so to do that same golf club I'm.gonna.the head of the golf club with my right.hand left hands on the handle I'm gonna.use that left hand to drive that right.hand out to my side and then all the way.up and over my head as high as I can.take it a lot of times if you don't get.into this motion regularly your inferior.capsule will get tight.that just means as you raise it up to.the side like this you might feel that a.little bit more aggressively in your.armpit that's where that stretch should.be if it's just painful to the top of.your shoulder I'd say give it up but if.you feel like it's pulling kind of.through that armpit even through that.lat muscle down there on the side that's.gonna be a good stretch for you you.guessed it three times twenty second.holds on that one.okay and so now let's get into my.doorway stretch as doorway stretches are.probably some of my favorite I'll show.you two right now and so similar to that.first one that I showed you with the.golf club that extension stretched back.behind you can replicate that on a.doorway let's talk about how you're.gonna come up to a doorway put both.hands low at about hip height on either.side of the door then take a step into.the doorway just until that comfortable.stretch is felt all through the front of.your chest in front of your shoulder.again that's one of my favorite for.anterior shoulder pain also one of my.favorite for like a biceps tendinitis.those are going to be good stretches for.that one three times twenty second holds.about 60 seconds of stretching a little.bit more aggressive let's get into a.doorway stretch high so now we're going.to take it up into maybe a little bit.more painful position but if you can.tolerate this it's a little bit more.effective stretch because we're going to.add a rotation component to it as well.so both forearms are up on the doorframe.now as I step into the door I'm getting.a pull through the front of my chest and.the front of my shoulders but then my.arm is also what we'd call externally.rotating so it's rotating kind of my.hand backwards as I'm up in that high.doorway position and so again three.times twenty second holds comfortable.stretch through the front of the chest.through the front of the shoulders is.what we're shooting forward with that.one okay and finally I've got one more.external rotation stretch so I'm just.going to show you right here this is.going to be up in this type of a.position and then we're gonna again.stretch the front of the chest and those.entry.rotators back into this position so to.do that I've got my golf club and what.I'm going to do is grab the handle on my.club and then just hold it behind my.back.and so you'll see I mean all I'm doing.is holding that golf club right here.behind my back now what I'm going to do.so my shoulder is at a ninety degree.from my body my elbow stays at a ninety.degree right here hand is on the handle.with that left hand I'm gonna reach over.and grab the bottom part of the club.down here and then hold on with my right.hand and I'm gonna pull my left hand.forward so right now I'm just pulling my.left hand towards you guys until I get.that external rotation in my shoulder so.the lateral view so I'm right here clubs.back behind me holding on with that.right hand left hand is going to grab.the golf club right down here as I pull.that bottom part of the club.you'll see what that's doing is actually.externally rotating it's taking my ship.my arm back into this position again.that's probably one of the more.aggressive stretches that I show people.but it's also one that is super.effective okay you guys so there you.have an eighth of my favorite stretches.for that shoulder joint and between all.of these that's probably what I.recommend the most often with you know.patients who come in with shoulder pain.who need to be stretched out that.collection or you know certain ones of.those exercises whatever that that.particular patient can tolerate make up.a lot of the home exercise programs that.I recommend for people so I hope that.something I showed you in there was.useful I hope that something in there.helps you out with some of the pain or.tightness that you might be experiencing.if it does you guys be sure to hit that.thumbs up button down below and like.this video if you have any questions or.comments about anything that I've talked.about please leave those down below and.I'll get to those just as soon as I can.one more plug for the channel be sure to.hit that subscribe button down there and.I'd love to see you back here for more.tone and tighten content if you guys.have any ideas for future videos you'd.like to see you feel free to leave those.in a comment down below.and until next time we'll see you right.back here on tone and

1PdyCdtkcGk,How can I do standing overhead stretch to help improve mobility in my shoulder?,"(513, 532)",club my right hand if that was my.painful shoulder goes right up on top of.the club left hand grabs the handle Im.gonna use my left hand to push my right.arm up as high as I can towards the.ceiling again the difference here is all.of a sudden my shoulder blade can rotate.up a little bit you should be able to.get a little more range of motion with.this however now were in a gravity.dependent position it does cause a,what's up guys hey Jared Beck strand.here doctor of physical therapy Conan.Titan calm do you suffer from shoulder.tightness or maybe limited shoulder.range of motion well today I wanted to.share with you eight of my favorite.stretches that you can do right at home.to help improve mobility in your.shoulder to stretch out that tightness.and hopefully help you guys to feel.better so let's get into it right now.[Music].all right you guys hey thank you so much.for joining me today here on tonin Titan.I'm excited to be able to share with you.a little bit about what I know about.this topic hopefully help you guys out.with some of the shoulder pain or the.limited mobility that you might feel.that you have in your shoulder if your.shoulder feels like it's stuck if it.feels like that range of motion is.limited I hope that I'll be able to.share some things with you guys today.that will help you out quick plug for.the channel if you have not done so.already go ahead and take this chance to.subscribe to tone and tighten here on.YouTube I try to share a lot of great.tips and advice some rehab tips even.some some home workouts some healthy.recipes my goal is to help you guys.become fitter healthier and even injury.free I hope you take the chance to.subscribe to this channel also if you do.like this video if you find the.information that I share useful I'd love.for you guys to hit that thumbs up.button down below and thank you so much.for that in advance okay so let's get.into it so your shoulder is the most.mobile joint in your body at least it.should be the most mobile joint in the.body it's capable of motion in three.different planes of motion we can go.forward and backwards we can go side to.side and then it can also rotate even up.here a little bit if you're limited in.one of those ranges of motion it can.actually affect other ranges of motion.as well it can cause pain it can pinch.on structures where it shouldn't be.pinching that can cause pain that can.cause issues such as impingement.tendonitis bursitis even rotator cuff.tears in very severe cases and so again.what I wanted to share with you guys.today.are about eight of my favorite stretches.to just improve mobility in your.shoulder to just create a little more.space to create a little more range of.motion one more point that I want to.make your shoulder will all the joints.in your body undergo what we call an.adaptive shortening or lengthening.meaning they're going to respond the the.ligaments the tendons the structures.they'll hold it together are going to.respond to stress is placed on them so.for example if I am regularly going into.these full ranges of motion with my.shoulder my shoulder joint is going to.stay loose and mobile however let's say.I get up here and my shoulder starts to.hurt so because of that pain response I.don't ever go up and over that point.because I know that's going to.I know that's going to be painful so.what happens is your structures in your.shoulder actually undergo that adaptive.shortening that all of a sudden that.becomes my limitation that becomes my.range of motion right there just because.those structures are so painful so if we.can create some more space in there if.we can create this lengthening in there.to get back up into that full range of.motion a lot of times that can help you.out with your shoulder pain so the most.common place that you're gonna feel pain.in your shoulder would be anterior and.superior meaning in the front and on the.top just given the arrangement of the.shoulder and the kind of the anatomy.behind it those places are a little more.susceptible to injury and therefore I.want to show you kind of more stretches.to stretch those out also these.stretches are going to go in order from.least intense to most intense so.hopefully you'll be able to tolerate at.least the first couple hopefully you'll.be able to tolerate all of them that.would be ideal if any of these cause.pain or discomfort beyond like a.stretching pain so I mean obviously.you're gonna feel it a little bit I want.you to feel like it's a good stretch but.I don't want it to feel pain and so I.tell people in my clinic I want you to.push to the point of pain but not in to.pain if it starts to become painful.you're pushing too hard so you need to.back off it a little bit or if it's.painful right from the get-go I want you.to just bail on it altogether and so try.to keep all of these stretches should be.as pain-free as possible so the first.stretch that I like we're gonna do a.wand extension stretch you're gonna get.a broom or a mop.in this video I'm gonna show you I've.got a golf club I feel like that's kind.of the most convenient and then we're.gonna take the shoulder again to stretch.that anterior shoulder out we need to.take it back behind us let's show you.how to do that you're gonna grab the.head of that golf club or whatever.you're using in your right hand your.left arm goes up high and then what.you're going to do is use your left arm.to push your right arm back behind you.as far as you can go should feel a.stretch right through the front of the.chest right in the front of the shoulder.he might fill it up through that biceps.a little bit and then you're just gonna.take it right back into that comfortable.position you're gonna hold it for 20.seconds again the stretch should be all.through the front of the shoulder 20.second hold you're going to.P that three times so that's stretch.number one stretch number two is going.to be an external rotator or a external.rotation stretch we're going to stretch.the tight internal rotators a lot of.times with posture if you're here all.day and if your shoulders are slumping.and rounding forward they're rounding.into what we call internal rotation I.want to come up and back here into this.external rotation position so what.you're gonna do is lay down on your back.still grab that same golf club broom mop.whatever you're gonna hold that in your.right hand.and then you're going to use your left.heart well so you're right right elbows.bent at a 90 degree angle your right.elbow is kept right into your side and.then you're gonna use your left arm to.push that right hand out towards the.side again just until a comfortable.stretch is felt through the front of.your shoulder now in this position you.should be able to get pretty close to 80.to 90 degrees of this external rotation.motion that means your forearm or the.back of your forearm should almost lay.down on the floor or whatever it is that.you're doing this exercise on if it's.not that's an indication that this would.be a good stretch for you.take it to where it's in a comfortable.position hold it there for 20 seconds.and then repeat that three times so.again that's going to stretch those.tight internal rotators if you happen to.be one of the I don't know called the.exception to the rule one of the fewer.that has the shoulder pain on the back.of your arm that could be indicative of.the external rotators being at play in.order to stretch those out we need to.get into an internal rotation stretch my.favorite one to show would be the.sleeper stretch what you're going to do.is lay down actually on your painful.side raise your arm up to about 90.degrees so your elbows out in front of.you with your elbow bent to a 90 degree.so here I'm laying on my left so if my.left shoulder was painful I'm gonna.bring it up into that 90 degree position.keep your elbow at at 90 use your right.hand on the back of your wrist to rotate.your forearm down towards the ground.into this what we call internal rotation.position now in this position you should.be able to get to about 70 to 80 degrees.of range of motion so not quite again.down to the table 90 degrees would be.all the way down to the table and if you.can't quite get.there that could be an indicator that.those external rotators are a little bit.tight you need to stretch into this.internal rotation range of motion okay.and so now let's get into what we would.call an overhead type motion we've done.a lot kind of down here in a safe.position for the shoulder again.progressing through intensity let's show.you some overhead stretches that I like.so the first one's going to be laying.down on your back you're still gonna.grab that same broom mop golf club.whatever it is that you're using and.then we're going to raise basically both.arms up and overhead now if my right.shoulder was painful I want that left.arm to do the lifting on this and so.your left arms doing the lifting your.right arm is holding on to that handle.and just kind of going along for the.right take it up as high as you can go.hold it as high as you can go pain free.hold it there for 20 seconds and then.repeat that one three times also and so.with that one your shoulder blades as.you're laying on the back on your back.it's a little easier to control but.because your shoulder blades are pinned.down to the ground.there's a little bit less range of.motion with that we'd hope to get up to.about a hundred and eighty degrees with.your shoulder blade pitch shoulder blade.pinned down you're only going to get up.to about a hundred and seventy or so you.need your shoulder blade to be free to.get through that last ten to fifteen.degrees of your range of motion so to do.that let's go ahead and try one standing.up now so I'm gonna grab my same golf.club my right hand if that was my.painful shoulder goes right up on top of.the club left hand grabs the handle I'm.gonna use my left hand to push my right.arm up as high as I can towards the.ceiling again the difference here is all.of a sudden my shoulder blade can rotate.up a little bit you should be able to.get a little more range of motion with.this however now we're in a gravity.dependent position it does cause a.little more stress on the shoulder joint.but if you can get to this one it's a.great stretch to stretch out again just.kind of the front of the shoulder you're.gonna feel that even under your armpit a.little bit take it to a pain-free.comfortable spot hold it for 20 seconds.and repeat that three times okay and so.again at the beginning of this video I.mentioned that that shoulder is a three.dimensional joint forward and backwards.let's get into some of the side to side.and so to do that same golf club I'm.gonna.the head of the golf club with my right.hand left hands on the handle I'm gonna.use that left hand to drive that right.hand out to my side and then all the way.up and over my head as high as I can.take it a lot of times if you don't get.into this motion regularly your inferior.capsule will get tight.that just means as you raise it up to.the side like this you might feel that a.little bit more aggressively in your.armpit that's where that stretch should.be if it's just painful to the top of.your shoulder I'd say give it up but if.you feel like it's pulling kind of.through that armpit even through that.lat muscle down there on the side that's.gonna be a good stretch for you you.guessed it three times twenty second.holds on that one.okay and so now let's get into my.doorway stretch as doorway stretches are.probably some of my favorite I'll show.you two right now and so similar to that.first one that I showed you with the.golf club that extension stretched back.behind you can replicate that on a.doorway let's talk about how you're.gonna come up to a doorway put both.hands low at about hip height on either.side of the door then take a step into.the doorway just until that comfortable.stretch is felt all through the front of.your chest in front of your shoulder.again that's one of my favorite for.anterior shoulder pain also one of my.favorite for like a biceps tendinitis.those are going to be good stretches for.that one three times twenty second holds.about 60 seconds of stretching a little.bit more aggressive let's get into a.doorway stretch high so now we're going.to take it up into maybe a little bit.more painful position but if you can.tolerate this it's a little bit more.effective stretch because we're going to.add a rotation component to it as well.so both forearms are up on the doorframe.now as I step into the door I'm getting.a pull through the front of my chest and.the front of my shoulders but then my.arm is also what we'd call externally.rotating so it's rotating kind of my.hand backwards as I'm up in that high.doorway position and so again three.times twenty second holds comfortable.stretch through the front of the chest.through the front of the shoulders is.what we're shooting forward with that.one okay and finally I've got one more.external rotation stretch so I'm just.going to show you right here this is.going to be up in this type of a.position and then we're gonna again.stretch the front of the chest and those.entry.rotators back into this position so to.do that I've got my golf club and what.I'm going to do is grab the handle on my.club and then just hold it behind my.back.and so you'll see I mean all I'm doing.is holding that golf club right here.behind my back now what I'm going to do.so my shoulder is at a ninety degree.from my body my elbow stays at a ninety.degree right here hand is on the handle.with that left hand I'm gonna reach over.and grab the bottom part of the club.down here and then hold on with my right.hand and I'm gonna pull my left hand.forward so right now I'm just pulling my.left hand towards you guys until I get.that external rotation in my shoulder so.the lateral view so I'm right here clubs.back behind me holding on with that.right hand left hand is going to grab.the golf club right down here as I pull.that bottom part of the club.you'll see what that's doing is actually.externally rotating it's taking my ship.my arm back into this position again.that's probably one of the more.aggressive stretches that I show people.but it's also one that is super.effective okay you guys so there you.have an eighth of my favorite stretches.for that shoulder joint and between all.of these that's probably what I.recommend the most often with you know.patients who come in with shoulder pain.who need to be stretched out that.collection or you know certain ones of.those exercises whatever that that.particular patient can tolerate make up.a lot of the home exercise programs that.I recommend for people so I hope that.something I showed you in there was.useful I hope that something in there.helps you out with some of the pain or.tightness that you might be experiencing.if it does you guys be sure to hit that.thumbs up button down below and like.this video if you have any questions or.comments about anything that I've talked.about please leave those down below and.I'll get to those just as soon as I can.one more plug for the channel be

1PdyCdtkcGk,How can I do shoulder abduction stretch to help improve mobility in my shoulder?,"(564, 583)",hand left hands on the handle Im gonna.use that left hand to drive that right.hand out to my side and then all the way.up and over my head as high as I can.take it a lot of times if you dont get.into this motion regularly your inferior.capsule will get tight.that just means as you raise it up to.the side like this you might feel that a.little bit more aggressively in your.armpit thats where that stretch should,what's up guys hey Jared Beck strand.here doctor of physical therapy Conan.Titan calm do you suffer from shoulder.tightness or maybe limited shoulder.range of motion well today I wanted to.share with you eight of my favorite.stretches that you can do right at home.to help improve mobility in your.shoulder to stretch out that tightness.and hopefully help you guys to feel.better so let's get into it right now.[Music].all right you guys hey thank you so much.for joining me today here on tonin Titan.I'm excited to be able to share with you.a little bit about what I know about.this topic hopefully help you guys out.with some of the shoulder pain or the.limited mobility that you might feel.that you have in your shoulder if your.shoulder feels like it's stuck if it.feels like that range of motion is.limited I hope that I'll be able to.share some things with you guys today.that will help you out quick plug for.the channel if you have not done so.already go ahead and take this chance to.subscribe to tone and tighten here on.YouTube I try to share a lot of great.tips and advice some rehab tips even.some some home workouts some healthy.recipes my goal is to help you guys.become fitter healthier and even injury.free I hope you take the chance to.subscribe to this channel also if you do.like this video if you find the.information that I share useful I'd love.for you guys to hit that thumbs up.button down below and thank you so much.for that in advance okay so let's get.into it so your shoulder is the most.mobile joint in your body at least it.should be the most mobile joint in the.body it's capable of motion in three.different planes of motion we can go.forward and backwards we can go side to.side and then it can also rotate even up.here a little bit if you're limited in.one of those ranges of motion it can.actually affect other ranges of motion.as well it can cause pain it can pinch.on structures where it shouldn't be.pinching that can cause pain that can.cause issues such as impingement.tendonitis bursitis even rotator cuff.tears in very severe cases and so again.what I wanted to share with you guys.today.are about eight of my favorite stretches.to just improve mobility in your.shoulder to just create a little more.space to create a little more range of.motion one more point that I want to.make your shoulder will all the joints.in your body undergo what we call an.adaptive shortening or lengthening.meaning they're going to respond the the.ligaments the tendons the structures.they'll hold it together are going to.respond to stress is placed on them so.for example if I am regularly going into.these full ranges of motion with my.shoulder my shoulder joint is going to.stay loose and mobile however let's say.I get up here and my shoulder starts to.hurt so because of that pain response I.don't ever go up and over that point.because I know that's going to.I know that's going to be painful so.what happens is your structures in your.shoulder actually undergo that adaptive.shortening that all of a sudden that.becomes my limitation that becomes my.range of motion right there just because.those structures are so painful so if we.can create some more space in there if.we can create this lengthening in there.to get back up into that full range of.motion a lot of times that can help you.out with your shoulder pain so the most.common place that you're gonna feel pain.in your shoulder would be anterior and.superior meaning in the front and on the.top just given the arrangement of the.shoulder and the kind of the anatomy.behind it those places are a little more.susceptible to injury and therefore I.want to show you kind of more stretches.to stretch those out also these.stretches are going to go in order from.least intense to most intense so.hopefully you'll be able to tolerate at.least the first couple hopefully you'll.be able to tolerate all of them that.would be ideal if any of these cause.pain or discomfort beyond like a.stretching pain so I mean obviously.you're gonna feel it a little bit I want.you to feel like it's a good stretch but.I don't want it to feel pain and so I.tell people in my clinic I want you to.push to the point of pain but not in to.pain if it starts to become painful.you're pushing too hard so you need to.back off it a little bit or if it's.painful right from the get-go I want you.to just bail on it altogether and so try.to keep all of these stretches should be.as pain-free as possible so the first.stretch that I like we're gonna do a.wand extension stretch you're gonna get.a broom or a mop.in this video I'm gonna show you I've.got a golf club I feel like that's kind.of the most convenient and then we're.gonna take the shoulder again to stretch.that anterior shoulder out we need to.take it back behind us let's show you.how to do that you're gonna grab the.head of that golf club or whatever.you're using in your right hand your.left arm goes up high and then what.you're going to do is use your left arm.to push your right arm back behind you.as far as you can go should feel a.stretch right through the front of the.chest right in the front of the shoulder.he might fill it up through that biceps.a little bit and then you're just gonna.take it right back into that comfortable.position you're gonna hold it for 20.seconds again the stretch should be all.through the front of the shoulder 20.second hold you're going to.P that three times so that's stretch.number one stretch number two is going.to be an external rotator or a external.rotation stretch we're going to stretch.the tight internal rotators a lot of.times with posture if you're here all.day and if your shoulders are slumping.and rounding forward they're rounding.into what we call internal rotation I.want to come up and back here into this.external rotation position so what.you're gonna do is lay down on your back.still grab that same golf club broom mop.whatever you're gonna hold that in your.right hand.and then you're going to use your left.heart well so you're right right elbows.bent at a 90 degree angle your right.elbow is kept right into your side and.then you're gonna use your left arm to.push that right hand out towards the.side again just until a comfortable.stretch is felt through the front of.your shoulder now in this position you.should be able to get pretty close to 80.to 90 degrees of this external rotation.motion that means your forearm or the.back of your forearm should almost lay.down on the floor or whatever it is that.you're doing this exercise on if it's.not that's an indication that this would.be a good stretch for you.take it to where it's in a comfortable.position hold it there for 20 seconds.and then repeat that three times so.again that's going to stretch those.tight internal rotators if you happen to.be one of the I don't know called the.exception to the rule one of the fewer.that has the shoulder pain on the back.of your arm that could be indicative of.the external rotators being at play in.order to stretch those out we need to.get into an internal rotation stretch my.favorite one to show would be the.sleeper stretch what you're going to do.is lay down actually on your painful.side raise your arm up to about 90.degrees so your elbows out in front of.you with your elbow bent to a 90 degree.so here I'm laying on my left so if my.left shoulder was painful I'm gonna.bring it up into that 90 degree position.keep your elbow at at 90 use your right.hand on the back of your wrist to rotate.your forearm down towards the ground.into this what we call internal rotation.position now in this position you should.be able to get to about 70 to 80 degrees.of range of motion so not quite again.down to the table 90 degrees would be.all the way down to the table and if you.can't quite get.there that could be an indicator that.those external rotators are a little bit.tight you need to stretch into this.internal rotation range of motion okay.and so now let's get into what we would.call an overhead type motion we've done.a lot kind of down here in a safe.position for the shoulder again.progressing through intensity let's show.you some overhead stretches that I like.so the first one's going to be laying.down on your back you're still gonna.grab that same broom mop golf club.whatever it is that you're using and.then we're going to raise basically both.arms up and overhead now if my right.shoulder was painful I want that left.arm to do the lifting on this and so.your left arms doing the lifting your.right arm is holding on to that handle.and just kind of going along for the.right take it up as high as you can go.hold it as high as you can go pain free.hold it there for 20 seconds and then.repeat that one three times also and so.with that one your shoulder blades as.you're laying on the back on your back.it's a little easier to control but.because your shoulder blades are pinned.down to the ground.there's a little bit less range of.motion with that we'd hope to get up to.about a hundred and eighty degrees with.your shoulder blade pitch shoulder blade.pinned down you're only going to get up.to about a hundred and seventy or so you.need your shoulder blade to be free to.get through that last ten to fifteen.degrees of your range of motion so to do.that let's go ahead and try one standing.up now so I'm gonna grab my same golf.club my right hand if that was my.painful shoulder goes right up on top of.the club left hand grabs the handle I'm.gonna use my left hand to push my right.arm up as high as I can towards the.ceiling again the difference here is all.of a sudden my shoulder blade can rotate.up a little bit you should be able to.get a little more range of motion with.this however now we're in a gravity.dependent position it does cause a.little more stress on the shoulder joint.but if you can get to this one it's a.great stretch to stretch out again just.kind of the front of the shoulder you're.gonna feel that even under your armpit a.little bit take it to a pain-free.comfortable spot hold it for 20 seconds.and repeat that three times okay and so.again at the beginning of this video I.mentioned that that shoulder is a three.dimensional joint forward and backwards.let's get into some of the side to side.and so to do that same golf club I'm.gonna.the head of the golf club with my right.hand left hands on the handle I'm gonna.use that left hand to drive that right.hand out to my side and then all the way.up and over my head as high as I can.take it a lot of times if you don't get.into this motion regularly your inferior.capsule will get tight.that just means as you raise it up to.the side like this you might feel that a.little bit more aggressively in your.armpit that's where that stretch should.be if it's just painful to the top of.your shoulder I'd say give it up but if.you feel like it's pulling kind of.through that armpit even through that.lat muscle down there on the side that's.gonna be a good stretch for you you.guessed it three times twenty second.holds on that one.okay and so now let's get into my.doorway stretch as doorway stretches are.probably some of my favorite I'll show.you two right now and so similar to that.first one that I showed you with the.golf club that extension stretched back.behind you can replicate that on a.doorway let's talk about how you're.gonna come up to a doorway put both.hands low at about hip height on either.side of the door then take a step into.the doorway just until that comfortable.stretch is felt all through the front of.your chest in front of your shoulder.again that's one of my favorite for.anterior shoulder pain also one of my.favorite for like a biceps tendinitis.those are going to be good stretches for.that one three times twenty second holds.about 60 seconds of stretching a little.bit more aggressive let's get into a.doorway stretch high so now we're going.to take it up into maybe a little bit.more painful position but if you can.tolerate this it's a little bit more.effective stretch because we're going to.add a rotation component to it as well.so both forearms are up on the doorframe.now as I step into the door I'm getting.a pull through the front of my chest and.the front of my shoulders but then my.arm is also what we'd call externally.rotating so it's rotating kind of my.hand backwards as I'm up in that high.doorway position and so again three.times twenty second holds comfortable.stretch through the front of the chest.through the front of the shoulders is.what we're shooting forward with that.one okay and finally I've got one more.external rotation stretch so I'm just.going to show you right here this is.going to be up in this type of a.position and then we're gonna again.stretch the front of the chest and those.entry.rotators back into this position so to.do that I've got my golf club and what.I'm going to do is grab the handle on my.club and then just hold it behind my.back.and so you'll see I mean all I'm doing.is holding that golf club right here.behind my back now what I'm going to do.so my shoulder is at a ninety degree.from my body my elbow stays at a ninety.degree right here hand is on the handle.with that left hand I'm gonna reach over.and grab the bottom part of the club.down here and then hold on with my right.hand and I'm gonna pull my left hand.forward so right now I'm just pulling my.left hand towards you guys until I get.that external rotation in my shoulder so.the lateral view so I'm right here clubs.back behind me holding on with that.right hand left hand is going to grab.the golf club right down here as I pull.that bottom part of the club.you'll see what that's doing is actually.externally rotating it's taking my ship.my arm back into this position again.that's probably one of the more.aggressive stretches that I show people.but it's also one that is super.effective okay you guys so there you.have an eighth of my favorite stretches.for that shoulder joint and between all.of these that's probably what I.recommend the most often with you know.patients who come in with shoulder pain.who need to be stretched out that.collection or you know certain ones of.those exercises whatever that that.particular patient can tolerate make up.a lot of the home exercise programs that.I recommend for people so I hope that.something I showed you in there was.useful I hope that something in there.helps you out with some of the pain or.tightness that you might be experiencing.if it does you guys be sure to hit that.thumbs up button down below and like.this video if you have any questions or.comments about anything that I've talked.about please leave those down below and.I'll get to those just as soon as I can.one more plug for the channel be

1PdyCdtkcGk,How can I do a low doorway stretch to help improve mobility in my shoulder?,"(615, 634)",doorway lets talk about how youre.gonna come up to a doorway put both.hands low at about hip height on either.side of the door then take a step into.the doorway just until that comfortable.stretch is felt all through the front of.your chest in front of your shoulder.again thats one of my favorite for.anterior shoulder pain also one of my.favorite for like a biceps tendinitis.those are going to be good stretches for,what's up guys hey Jared Beck strand.here doctor of physical therapy Conan.Titan calm do you suffer from shoulder.tightness or maybe limited shoulder.range of motion well today I wanted to.share with you eight of my favorite.stretches that you can do right at home.to help improve mobility in your.shoulder to stretch out that tightness.and hopefully help you guys to feel.better so let's get into it right now.[Music].all right you guys hey thank you so much.for joining me today here on tonin Titan.I'm excited to be able to share with you.a little bit about what I know about.this topic hopefully help you guys out.with some of the shoulder pain or the.limited mobility that you might feel.that you have in your shoulder if your.shoulder feels like it's stuck if it.feels like that range of motion is.limited I hope that I'll be able to.share some things with you guys today.that will help you out quick plug for.the channel if you have not done so.already go ahead and take this chance to.subscribe to tone and tighten here on.YouTube I try to share a lot of great.tips and advice some rehab tips even.some some home workouts some healthy.recipes my goal is to help you guys.become fitter healthier and even injury.free I hope you take the chance to.subscribe to this channel also if you do.like this video if you find the.information that I share useful I'd love.for you guys to hit that thumbs up.button down below and thank you so much.for that in advance okay so let's get.into it so your shoulder is the most.mobile joint in your body at least it.should be the most mobile joint in the.body it's capable of motion in three.different planes of motion we can go.forward and backwards we can go side to.side and then it can also rotate even up.here a little bit if you're limited in.one of those ranges of motion it can.actually affect other ranges of motion.as well it can cause pain it can pinch.on structures where it shouldn't be.pinching that can cause pain that can.cause issues such as impingement.tendonitis bursitis even rotator cuff.tears in very severe cases and so again.what I wanted to share with you guys.today.are about eight of my favorite stretches.to just improve mobility in your.shoulder to just create a little more.space to create a little more range of.motion one more point that I want to.make your shoulder will all the joints.in your body undergo what we call an.adaptive shortening or lengthening.meaning they're going to respond the the.ligaments the tendons the structures.they'll hold it together are going to.respond to stress is placed on them so.for example if I am regularly going into.these full ranges of motion with my.shoulder my shoulder joint is going to.stay loose and mobile however let's say.I get up here and my shoulder starts to.hurt so because of that pain response I.don't ever go up and over that point.because I know that's going to.I know that's going to be painful so.what happens is your structures in your.shoulder actually undergo that adaptive.shortening that all of a sudden that.becomes my limitation that becomes my.range of motion right there just because.those structures are so painful so if we.can create some more space in there if.we can create this lengthening in there.to get back up into that full range of.motion a lot of times that can help you.out with your shoulder pain so the most.common place that you're gonna feel pain.in your shoulder would be anterior and.superior meaning in the front and on the.top just given the arrangement of the.shoulder and the kind of the anatomy.behind it those places are a little more.susceptible to injury and therefore I.want to show you kind of more stretches.to stretch those out also these.stretches are going to go in order from.least intense to most intense so.hopefully you'll be able to tolerate at.least the first couple hopefully you'll.be able to tolerate all of them that.would be ideal if any of these cause.pain or discomfort beyond like a.stretching pain so I mean obviously.you're gonna feel it a little bit I want.you to feel like it's a good stretch but.I don't want it to feel pain and so I.tell people in my clinic I want you to.push to the point of pain but not in to.pain if it starts to become painful.you're pushing too hard so you need to.back off it a little bit or if it's.painful right from the get-go I want you.to just bail on it altogether and so try.to keep all of these stretches should be.as pain-free as possible so the first.stretch that I like we're gonna do a.wand extension stretch you're gonna get.a broom or a mop.in this video I'm gonna show you I've.got a golf club I feel like that's kind.of the most convenient and then we're.gonna take the shoulder again to stretch.that anterior shoulder out we need to.take it back behind us let's show you.how to do that you're gonna grab the.head of that golf club or whatever.you're using in your right hand your.left arm goes up high and then what.you're going to do is use your left arm.to push your right arm back behind you.as far as you can go should feel a.stretch right through the front of the.chest right in the front of the shoulder.he might fill it up through that biceps.a little bit and then you're just gonna.take it right back into that comfortable.position you're gonna hold it for 20.seconds again the stretch should be all.through the front of the shoulder 20.second hold you're going to.P that three times so that's stretch.number one stretch number two is going.to be an external rotator or a external.rotation stretch we're going to stretch.the tight internal rotators a lot of.times with posture if you're here all.day and if your shoulders are slumping.and rounding forward they're rounding.into what we call internal rotation I.want to come up and back here into this.external rotation position so what.you're gonna do is lay down on your back.still grab that same golf club broom mop.whatever you're gonna hold that in your.right hand.and then you're going to use your left.heart well so you're right right elbows.bent at a 90 degree angle your right.elbow is kept right into your side and.then you're gonna use your left arm to.push that right hand out towards the.side again just until a comfortable.stretch is felt through the front of.your shoulder now in this position you.should be able to get pretty close to 80.to 90 degrees of this external rotation.motion that means your forearm or the.back of your forearm should almost lay.down on the floor or whatever it is that.you're doing this exercise on if it's.not that's an indication that this would.be a good stretch for you.take it to where it's in a comfortable.position hold it there for 20 seconds.and then repeat that three times so.again that's going to stretch those.tight internal rotators if you happen to.be one of the I don't know called the.exception to the rule one of the fewer.that has the shoulder pain on the back.of your arm that could be indicative of.the external rotators being at play in.order to stretch those out we need to.get into an internal rotation stretch my.favorite one to show would be the.sleeper stretch what you're going to do.is lay down actually on your painful.side raise your arm up to about 90.degrees so your elbows out in front of.you with your elbow bent to a 90 degree.so here I'm laying on my left so if my.left shoulder was painful I'm gonna.bring it up into that 90 degree position.keep your elbow at at 90 use your right.hand on the back of your wrist to rotate.your forearm down towards the ground.into this what we call internal rotation.position now in this position you should.be able to get to about 70 to 80 degrees.of range of motion so not quite again.down to the table 90 degrees would be.all the way down to the table and if you.can't quite get.there that could be an indicator that.those external rotators are a little bit.tight you need to stretch into this.internal rotation range of motion okay.and so now let's get into what we would.call an overhead type motion we've done.a lot kind of down here in a safe.position for the shoulder again.progressing through intensity let's show.you some overhead stretches that I like.so the first one's going to be laying.down on your back you're still gonna.grab that same broom mop golf club.whatever it is that you're using and.then we're going to raise basically both.arms up and overhead now if my right.shoulder was painful I want that left.arm to do the lifting on this and so.your left arms doing the lifting your.right arm is holding on to that handle.and just kind of going along for the.right take it up as high as you can go.hold it as high as you can go pain free.hold it there for 20 seconds and then.repeat that one three times also and so.with that one your shoulder blades as.you're laying on the back on your back.it's a little easier to control but.because your shoulder blades are pinned.down to the ground.there's a little bit less range of.motion with that we'd hope to get up to.about a hundred and eighty degrees with.your shoulder blade pitch shoulder blade.pinned down you're only going to get up.to about a hundred and seventy or so you.need your shoulder blade to be free to.get through that last ten to fifteen.degrees of your range of motion so to do.that let's go ahead and try one standing.up now so I'm gonna grab my same golf.club my right hand if that was my.painful shoulder goes right up on top of.the club left hand grabs the handle I'm.gonna use my left hand to push my right.arm up as high as I can towards the.ceiling again the difference here is all.of a sudden my shoulder blade can rotate.up a little bit you should be able to.get a little more range of motion with.this however now we're in a gravity.dependent position it does cause a.little more stress on the shoulder joint.but if you can get to this one it's a.great stretch to stretch out again just.kind of the front of the shoulder you're.gonna feel that even under your armpit a.little bit take it to a pain-free.comfortable spot hold it for 20 seconds.and repeat that three times okay and so.again at the beginning of this video I.mentioned that that shoulder is a three.dimensional joint forward and backwards.let's get into some of the side to side.and so to do that same golf club I'm.gonna.the head of the golf club with my right.hand left hands on the handle I'm gonna.use that left hand to drive that right.hand out to my side and then all the way.up and over my head as high as I can.take it a lot of times if you don't get.into this motion regularly your inferior.capsule will get tight.that just means as you raise it up to.the side like this you might feel that a.little bit more aggressively in your.armpit that's where that stretch should.be if it's just painful to the top of.your shoulder I'd say give it up but if.you feel like it's pulling kind of.through that armpit even through that.lat muscle down there on the side that's.gonna be a good stretch for you you.guessed it three times twenty second.holds on that one.okay and so now let's get into my.doorway stretch as doorway stretches are.probably some of my favorite I'll show.you two right now and so similar to that.first one that I showed you with the.golf club that extension stretched back.behind you can replicate that on a.doorway let's talk about how you're.gonna come up to a doorway put both.hands low at about hip height on either.side of the door then take a step into.the doorway just until that comfortable.stretch is felt all through the front of.your chest in front of your shoulder.again that's one of my favorite for.anterior shoulder pain also one of my.favorite for like a biceps tendinitis.those are going to be good stretches for.that one three times twenty second holds.about 60 seconds of stretching a little.bit more aggressive let's get into a.doorway stretch high so now we're going.to take it up into maybe a little bit.more painful position but if you can.tolerate this it's a little bit more.effective stretch because we're going to.add a rotation component to it as well.so both forearms are up on the doorframe.now as I step into the door I'm getting.a pull through the front of my chest and.the front of my shoulders but then my.arm is also what we'd call externally.rotating so it's rotating kind of my.hand backwards as I'm up in that high.doorway position and so again three.times twenty second holds comfortable.stretch through the front of the chest.through the front of the shoulders is.what we're shooting forward with that.one okay and finally I've got one more.external rotation stretch so I'm just.going to show you right here this is.going to be up in this type of a.position and then we're gonna again.stretch the front of the chest and those.entry.rotators back into this position so to.do that I've got my golf club and what.I'm going to do is grab the handle on my.club and then just hold it behind my.back.and so you'll see I mean all I'm doing.is holding that golf club right here.behind my back now what I'm going to do.so my shoulder is at a ninety degree.from my body my elbow stays at a ninety.degree right here hand is on the handle.with that left hand I'm gonna reach over.and grab the bottom part of the club.down here and then hold on with my right.hand and I'm gonna pull my left hand.forward so right now I'm just pulling my.left hand towards you guys until I get.that external rotation in my shoulder so.the lateral view so I'm right here clubs.back behind me holding on with that.right hand left hand is going to grab.the golf club right down here as I pull.that bottom part of the club.you'll see what that's doing is actually.externally rotating it's taking my ship.my arm back into this position again.that's probably one of the more.aggressive stretches that I show people.but it's also one that is super.effective okay you guys so there you.have an eighth of my favorite stretches.for that shoulder joint and between all.of these that's probably what I.recommend the most often with you know.patients who come in with shoulder pain.who need to be stretched out that.collection or you know certain ones of.those exercises whatever that that.particular patient can tolerate make up.a lot of the home exercise programs that.I recommend for people so I hope that.something I showed you in there was.useful I hope that something in there.helps you out with some of the pain or.tightness that you might be experiencing.if it does you guys be sure to hit that.thumbs up button down below and like.this video if you have any questions or.comments about anything that I've talked.about please leave those down below and.I'll get to those just as soon as I can.one more plug for the channel be

1PdyCdtkcGk,How can I do a high doorway stretch to help improve mobility in my shoulder?,"(654, 677)",add a rotation component to it as well.so both forearms are up on the doorframe.now as I step into the door Im getting.a pull through the front of my chest and.the front of my shoulders but then my.arm is also what wed call externally.rotating so its rotating kind of my.hand backwards as Im up in that high.doorway position and so again three.times twenty second holds comfortable.stretch through the front of the chest.through the front of the shoulders is,what's up guys hey Jared Beck strand.here doctor of physical therapy Conan.Titan calm do you suffer from shoulder.tightness or maybe limited shoulder.range of motion well today I wanted to.share with you eight of my favorite.stretches that you can do right at home.to help improve mobility in your.shoulder to stretch out that tightness.and hopefully help you guys to feel.better so let's get into it right now.[Music].all right you guys hey thank you so much.for joining me today here on tonin Titan.I'm excited to be able to share with you.a little bit about what I know about.this topic hopefully help you guys out.with some of the shoulder pain or the.limited mobility that you might feel.that you have in your shoulder if your.shoulder feels like it's stuck if it.feels like that range of motion is.limited I hope that I'll be able to.share some things with you guys today.that will help you out quick plug for.the channel if you have not done so.already go ahead and take this chance to.subscribe to tone and tighten here on.YouTube I try to share a lot of great.tips and advice some rehab tips even.some some home workouts some healthy.recipes my goal is to help you guys.become fitter healthier and even injury.free I hope you take the chance to.subscribe to this channel also if you do.like this video if you find the.information that I share useful I'd love.for you guys to hit that thumbs up.button down below and thank you so much.for that in advance okay so let's get.into it so your shoulder is the most.mobile joint in your body at least it.should be the most mobile joint in the.body it's capable of motion in three.different planes of motion we can go.forward and backwards we can go side to.side and then it can also rotate even up.here a little bit if you're limited in.one of those ranges of motion it can.actually affect other ranges of motion.as well it can cause pain it can pinch.on structures where it shouldn't be.pinching that can cause pain that can.cause issues such as impingement.tendonitis bursitis even rotator cuff.tears in very severe cases and so again.what I wanted to share with you guys.today.are about eight of my favorite stretches.to just improve mobility in your.shoulder to just create a little more.space to create a little more range of.motion one more point that I want to.make your shoulder will all the joints.in your body undergo what we call an.adaptive shortening or lengthening.meaning they're going to respond the the.ligaments the tendons the structures.they'll hold it together are going to.respond to stress is placed on them so.for example if I am regularly going into.these full ranges of motion with my.shoulder my shoulder joint is going to.stay loose and mobile however let's say.I get up here and my shoulder starts to.hurt so because of that pain response I.don't ever go up and over that point.because I know that's going to.I know that's going to be painful so.what happens is your structures in your.shoulder actually undergo that adaptive.shortening that all of a sudden that.becomes my limitation that becomes my.range of motion right there just because.those structures are so painful so if we.can create some more space in there if.we can create this lengthening in there.to get back up into that full range of.motion a lot of times that can help you.out with your shoulder pain so the most.common place that you're gonna feel pain.in your shoulder would be anterior and.superior meaning in the front and on the.top just given the arrangement of the.shoulder and the kind of the anatomy.behind it those places are a little more.susceptible to injury and therefore I.want to show you kind of more stretches.to stretch those out also these.stretches are going to go in order from.least intense to most intense so.hopefully you'll be able to tolerate at.least the first couple hopefully you'll.be able to tolerate all of them that.would be ideal if any of these cause.pain or discomfort beyond like a.stretching pain so I mean obviously.you're gonna feel it a little bit I want.you to feel like it's a good stretch but.I don't want it to feel pain and so I.tell people in my clinic I want you to.push to the point of pain but not in to.pain if it starts to become painful.you're pushing too hard so you need to.back off it a little bit or if it's.painful right from the get-go I want you.to just bail on it altogether and so try.to keep all of these stretches should be.as pain-free as possible so the first.stretch that I like we're gonna do a.wand extension stretch you're gonna get.a broom or a mop.in this video I'm gonna show you I've.got a golf club I feel like that's kind.of the most convenient and then we're.gonna take the shoulder again to stretch.that anterior shoulder out we need to.take it back behind us let's show you.how to do that you're gonna grab the.head of that golf club or whatever.you're using in your right hand your.left arm goes up high and then what.you're going to do is use your left arm.to push your right arm back behind you.as far as you can go should feel a.stretch right through the front of the.chest right in the front of the shoulder.he might fill it up through that biceps.a little bit and then you're just gonna.take it right back into that comfortable.position you're gonna hold it for 20.seconds again the stretch should be all.through the front of the shoulder 20.second hold you're going to.P that three times so that's stretch.number one stretch number two is going.to be an external rotator or a external.rotation stretch we're going to stretch.the tight internal rotators a lot of.times with posture if you're here all.day and if your shoulders are slumping.and rounding forward they're rounding.into what we call internal rotation I.want to come up and back here into this.external rotation position so what.you're gonna do is lay down on your back.still grab that same golf club broom mop.whatever you're gonna hold that in your.right hand.and then you're going to use your left.heart well so you're right right elbows.bent at a 90 degree angle your right.elbow is kept right into your side and.then you're gonna use your left arm to.push that right hand out towards the.side again just until a comfortable.stretch is felt through the front of.your shoulder now in this position you.should be able to get pretty close to 80.to 90 degrees of this external rotation.motion that means your forearm or the.back of your forearm should almost lay.down on the floor or whatever it is that.you're doing this exercise on if it's.not that's an indication that this would.be a good stretch for you.take it to where it's in a comfortable.position hold it there for 20 seconds.and then repeat that three times so.again that's going to stretch those.tight internal rotators if you happen to.be one of the I don't know called the.exception to the rule one of the fewer.that has the shoulder pain on the back.of your arm that could be indicative of.the external rotators being at play in.order to stretch those out we need to.get into an internal rotation stretch my.favorite one to show would be the.sleeper stretch what you're going to do.is lay down actually on your painful.side raise your arm up to about 90.degrees so your elbows out in front of.you with your elbow bent to a 90 degree.so here I'm laying on my left so if my.left shoulder was painful I'm gonna.bring it up into that 90 degree position.keep your elbow at at 90 use your right.hand on the back of your wrist to rotate.your forearm down towards the ground.into this what we call internal rotation.position now in this position you should.be able to get to about 70 to 80 degrees.of range of motion so not quite again.down to the table 90 degrees would be.all the way down to the table and if you.can't quite get.there that could be an indicator that.those external rotators are a little bit.tight you need to stretch into this.internal rotation range of motion okay.and so now let's get into what we would.call an overhead type motion we've done.a lot kind of down here in a safe.position for the shoulder again.progressing through intensity let's show.you some overhead stretches that I like.so the first one's going to be laying.down on your back you're still gonna.grab that same broom mop golf club.whatever it is that you're using and.then we're going to raise basically both.arms up and overhead now if my right.shoulder was painful I want that left.arm to do the lifting on this and so.your left arms doing the lifting your.right arm is holding on to that handle.and just kind of going along for the.right take it up as high as you can go.hold it as high as you can go pain free.hold it there for 20 seconds and then.repeat that one three times also and so.with that one your shoulder blades as.you're laying on the back on your back.it's a little easier to control but.because your shoulder blades are pinned.down to the ground.there's a little bit less range of.motion with that we'd hope to get up to.about a hundred and eighty degrees with.your shoulder blade pitch shoulder blade.pinned down you're only going to get up.to about a hundred and seventy or so you.need your shoulder blade to be free to.get through that last ten to fifteen.degrees of your range of motion so to do.that let's go ahead and try one standing.up now so I'm gonna grab my same golf.club my right hand if that was my.painful shoulder goes right up on top of.the club left hand grabs the handle I'm.gonna use my left hand to push my right.arm up as high as I can towards the.ceiling again the difference here is all.of a sudden my shoulder blade can rotate.up a little bit you should be able to.get a little more range of motion with.this however now we're in a gravity.dependent position it does cause a.little more stress on the shoulder joint.but if you can get to this one it's a.great stretch to stretch out again just.kind of the front of the shoulder you're.gonna feel that even under your armpit a.little bit take it to a pain-free.comfortable spot hold it for 20 seconds.and repeat that three times okay and so.again at the beginning of this video I.mentioned that that shoulder is a three.dimensional joint forward and backwards.let's get into some of the side to side.and so to do that same golf club I'm.gonna.the head of the golf club with my right.hand left hands on the handle I'm gonna.use that left hand to drive that right.hand out to my side and then all the way.up and over my head as high as I can.take it a lot of times if you don't get.into this motion regularly your inferior.capsule will get tight.that just means as you raise it up to.the side like this you might feel that a.little bit more aggressively in your.armpit that's where that stretch should.be if it's just painful to the top of.your shoulder I'd say give it up but if.you feel like it's pulling kind of.through that armpit even through that.lat muscle down there on the side that's.gonna be a good stretch for you you.guessed it three times twenty second.holds on that one.okay and so now let's get into my.doorway stretch as doorway stretches are.probably some of my favorite I'll show.you two right now and so similar to that.first one that I showed you with the.golf club that extension stretched back.behind you can replicate that on a.doorway let's talk about how you're.gonna come up to a doorway put both.hands low at about hip height on either.side of the door then take a step into.the doorway just until that comfortable.stretch is felt all through the front of.your chest in front of your shoulder.again that's one of my favorite for.anterior shoulder pain also one of my.favorite for like a biceps tendinitis.those are going to be good stretches for.that one three times twenty second holds.about 60 seconds of stretching a little.bit more aggressive let's get into a.doorway stretch high so now we're going.to take it up into maybe a little bit.more painful position but if you can.tolerate this it's a little bit more.effective stretch because we're going to.add a rotation component to it as well.so both forearms are up on the doorframe.now as I step into the door I'm getting.a pull through the front of my chest and.the front of my shoulders but then my.arm is also what we'd call externally.rotating so it's rotating kind of my.hand backwards as I'm up in that high.doorway position and so again three.times twenty second holds comfortable.stretch through the front of the chest.through the front of the shoulders is.what we're shooting forward with that.one okay and finally I've got one more.external rotation stretch so I'm just.going to show you right here this is.going to be up in this type of a.position and then we're gonna again.stretch the front of the chest and those.entry.rotators back into this position so to.do that I've got my golf club and what.I'm going to do is grab the handle on my.club and then just hold it behind my.back.and so you'll see I mean all I'm doing.is holding that golf club right here.behind my back now what I'm going to do.so my shoulder is at a ninety degree.from my body my elbow stays at a ninety.degree right here hand is on the handle.with that left hand I'm gonna reach over.and grab the bottom part of the club.down here and then hold on with my right.hand and I'm gonna pull my left hand.forward so right now I'm just pulling my.left hand towards you guys until I get.that external rotation in my shoulder so.the lateral view so I'm right here clubs.back behind me holding on with that.right hand left hand is going to grab.the golf club right down here as I pull.that bottom part of the club.you'll see what that's doing is actually.externally rotating it's taking my ship.my arm back into this position again.that's probably one of the more.aggressive stretches that I show people.but it's also one that is super.effective okay you guys so there you.have an eighth of my favorite stretches.for that shoulder joint and between all.of these that's probably what I.recommend the most often with you know.patients who come in with shoulder pain.who need to be stretched out that.collection or you know certain ones of.those exercises whatever that that.particular patient can tolerate make up.a lot of the home exercise programs that.I recommend for people so I hope that.something I showed you in there was.useful I hope that something in there.helps you out with some of the pain or.tightness that you might be experiencing.if it does you guys be sure to hit that.thumbs up button down below and like.this video if you have any questions or.comments about anything that I've talked.about please leave those down below and.I'll get to those just as soon as I can.one more plug for the channel be sure to.hit that subscribe button down there and.I'd love to see you back here for more.tone and

1PdyCdtkcGk,How can I do a standing external rotation stretch to help improve mobility in my shoulder?,"(696, 750)",rotators back into this position so to.do that Ive got my golf club and what.Im going to do is grab the handle on my.club and then just hold it behind my.back.and so youll see I mean all Im doing.is holding that golf club right here.behind my back now what Im going to do.so my shoulder is at a ninety degree.from my body my elbow stays at a ninety.degree right here hand is on the handle.with that left hand Im gonna reach over.and grab the bottom part of the club.down here and then hold on with my right.hand and Im gonna pull my left hand.forward so right now Im just pulling my.left hand towards you guys until I get.that external rotation in my shoulder so.the lateral view so Im right here clubs.back behind me holding on with that.right hand left hand is going to grab.the golf club right down here as I pull.that bottom part of the club.youll see what thats doing is actually.externally rotating its taking my ship.my arm back into this position again.thats probably one of the more.aggressive stretches that I show people,what's up guys hey Jared Beck strand.here doctor of physical therapy Conan.Titan calm do you suffer from shoulder.tightness or maybe limited shoulder.range of motion well today I wanted to.share with you eight of my favorite.stretches that you can do right at home.to help improve mobility in your.shoulder to stretch out that tightness.and hopefully help you guys to feel.better so let's get into it right now.[Music].all right you guys hey thank you so much.for joining me today here on tonin Titan.I'm excited to be able to share with you.a little bit about what I know about.this topic hopefully help you guys out.with some of the shoulder pain or the.limited mobility that you might feel.that you have in your shoulder if your.shoulder feels like it's stuck if it.feels like that range of motion is.limited I hope that I'll be able to.share some things with you guys today.that will help you out quick plug for.the channel if you have not done so.already go ahead and take this chance to.subscribe to tone and tighten here on.YouTube I try to share a lot of great.tips and advice some rehab tips even.some some home workouts some healthy.recipes my goal is to help you guys.become fitter healthier and even injury.free I hope you take the chance to.subscribe to this channel also if you do.like this video if you find the.information that I share useful I'd love.for you guys to hit that thumbs up.button down below and thank you so much.for that in advance okay so let's get.into it so your shoulder is the most.mobile joint in your body at least it.should be the most mobile joint in the.body it's capable of motion in three.different planes of motion we can go.forward and backwards we can go side to.side and then it can also rotate even up.here a little bit if you're limited in.one of those ranges of motion it can.actually affect other ranges of motion.as well it can cause pain it can pinch.on structures where it shouldn't be.pinching that can cause pain that can.cause issues such as impingement.tendonitis bursitis even rotator cuff.tears in very severe cases and so again.what I wanted to share with you guys.today.are about eight of my favorite stretches.to just improve mobility in your.shoulder to just create a little more.space to create a little more range of.motion one more point that I want to.make your shoulder will all the joints.in your body undergo what we call an.adaptive shortening or lengthening.meaning they're going to respond the the.ligaments the tendons the structures.they'll hold it together are going to.respond to stress is placed on them so.for example if I am regularly going into.these full ranges of motion with my.shoulder my shoulder joint is going to.stay loose and mobile however let's say.I get up here and my shoulder starts to.hurt so because of that pain response I.don't ever go up and over that point.because I know that's going to.I know that's going to be painful so.what happens is your structures in your.shoulder actually undergo that adaptive.shortening that all of a sudden that.becomes my limitation that becomes my.range of motion right there just because.those structures are so painful so if we.can create some more space in there if.we can create this lengthening in there.to get back up into that full range of.motion a lot of times that can help you.out with your shoulder pain so the most.common place that you're gonna feel pain.in your shoulder would be anterior and.superior meaning in the front and on the.top just given the arrangement of the.shoulder and the kind of the anatomy.behind it those places are a little more.susceptible to injury and therefore I.want to show you kind of more stretches.to stretch those out also these.stretches are going to go in order from.least intense to most intense so.hopefully you'll be able to tolerate at.least the first couple hopefully you'll.be able to tolerate all of them that.would be ideal if any of these cause.pain or discomfort beyond like a.stretching pain so I mean obviously.you're gonna feel it a little bit I want.you to feel like it's a good stretch but.I don't want it to feel pain and so I.tell people in my clinic I want you to.push to the point of pain but not in to.pain if it starts to become painful.you're pushing too hard so you need to.back off it a little bit or if it's.painful right from the get-go I want you.to just bail on it altogether and so try.to keep all of these stretches should be.as pain-free as possible so the first.stretch that I like we're gonna do a.wand extension stretch you're gonna get.a broom or a mop.in this video I'm gonna show you I've.got a golf club I feel like that's kind.of the most convenient and then we're.gonna take the shoulder again to stretch.that anterior shoulder out we need to.take it back behind us let's show you.how to do that you're gonna grab the.head of that golf club or whatever.you're using in your right hand your.left arm goes up high and then what.you're going to do is use your left arm.to push your right arm back behind you.as far as you can go should feel a.stretch right through the front of the.chest right in the front of the shoulder.he might fill it up through that biceps.a little bit and then you're just gonna.take it right back into that comfortable.position you're gonna hold it for 20.seconds again the stretch should be all.through the front of the shoulder 20.second hold you're going to.P that three times so that's stretch.number one stretch number two is going.to be an external rotator or a external.rotation stretch we're going to stretch.the tight internal rotators a lot of.times with posture if you're here all.day and if your shoulders are slumping.and rounding forward they're rounding.into what we call internal rotation I.want to come up and back here into this.external rotation position so what.you're gonna do is lay down on your back.still grab that same golf club broom mop.whatever you're gonna hold that in your.right hand.and then you're going to use your left.heart well so you're right right elbows.bent at a 90 degree angle your right.elbow is kept right into your side and.then you're gonna use your left arm to.push that right hand out towards the.side again just until a comfortable.stretch is felt through the front of.your shoulder now in this position you.should be able to get pretty close to 80.to 90 degrees of this external rotation.motion that means your forearm or the.back of your forearm should almost lay.down on the floor or whatever it is that.you're doing this exercise on if it's.not that's an indication that this would.be a good stretch for you.take it to where it's in a comfortable.position hold it there for 20 seconds.and then repeat that three times so.again that's going to stretch those.tight internal rotators if you happen to.be one of the I don't know called the.exception to the rule one of the fewer.that has the shoulder pain on the back.of your arm that could be indicative of.the external rotators being at play in.order to stretch those out we need to.get into an internal rotation stretch my.favorite one to show would be the.sleeper stretch what you're going to do.is lay down actually on your painful.side raise your arm up to about 90.degrees so your elbows out in front of.you with your elbow bent to a 90 degree.so here I'm laying on my left so if my.left shoulder was painful I'm gonna.bring it up into that 90 degree position.keep your elbow at at 90 use your right.hand on the back of your wrist to rotate.your forearm down towards the ground.into this what we call internal rotation.position now in this position you should.be able to get to about 70 to 80 degrees.of range of motion so not quite again.down to the table 90 degrees would be.all the way down to the table and if you.can't quite get.there that could be an indicator that.those external rotators are a little bit.tight you need to stretch into this.internal rotation range of motion okay.and so now let's get into what we would.call an overhead type motion we've done.a lot kind of down here in a safe.position for the shoulder again.progressing through intensity let's show.you some overhead stretches that I like.so the first one's going to be laying.down on your back you're still gonna.grab that same broom mop golf club.whatever it is that you're using and.then we're going to raise basically both.arms up and overhead now if my right.shoulder was painful I want that left.arm to do the lifting on this and so.your left arms doing the lifting your.right arm is holding on to that handle.and just kind of going along for the.right take it up as high as you can go.hold it as high as you can go pain free.hold it there for 20 seconds and then.repeat that one three times also and so.with that one your shoulder blades as.you're laying on the back on your back.it's a little easier to control but.because your shoulder blades are pinned.down to the ground.there's a little bit less range of.motion with that we'd hope to get up to.about a hundred and eighty degrees with.your shoulder blade pitch shoulder blade.pinned down you're only going to get up.to about a hundred and seventy or so you.need your shoulder blade to be free to.get through that last ten to fifteen.degrees of your range of motion so to do.that let's go ahead and try one standing.up now so I'm gonna grab my same golf.club my right hand if that was my.painful shoulder goes right up on top of.the club left hand grabs the handle I'm.gonna use my left hand to push my right.arm up as high as I can towards the.ceiling again the difference here is all.of a sudden my shoulder blade can rotate.up a little bit you should be able to.get a little more range of motion with.this however now we're in a gravity.dependent position it does cause a.little more stress on the shoulder joint.but if you can get to this one it's a.great stretch to stretch out again just.kind of the front of the shoulder you're.gonna feel that even under your armpit a.little bit take it to a pain-free.comfortable spot hold it for 20 seconds.and repeat that three times okay and so.again at the beginning of this video I.mentioned that that shoulder is a three.dimensional joint forward and backwards.let's get into some of the side to side.and so to do that same golf club I'm.gonna.the head of the golf club with my right.hand left hands on the handle I'm gonna.use that left hand to drive that right.hand out to my side and then all the way.up and over my head as high as I can.take it a lot of times if you don't get.into this motion regularly your inferior.capsule will get tight.that just means as you raise it up to.the side like this you might feel that a.little bit more aggressively in your.armpit that's where that stretch should.be if it's just painful to the top of.your shoulder I'd say give it up but if.you feel like it's pulling kind of.through that armpit even through that.lat muscle down there on the side that's.gonna be a good stretch for you you.guessed it three times twenty second.holds on that one.okay and so now let's get into my.doorway stretch as doorway stretches are.probably some of my favorite I'll show.you two right now and so similar to that.first one that I showed you with the.golf club that extension stretched back.behind you can replicate that on a.doorway let's talk about how you're.gonna come up to a doorway put both.hands low at about hip height on either.side of the door then take a step into.the doorway just until that comfortable.stretch is felt all through the front of.your chest in front of your shoulder.again that's one of my favorite for.anterior shoulder pain also one of my.favorite for like a biceps tendinitis.those are going to be good stretches for.that one three times twenty second holds.about 60 seconds of stretching a little.bit more aggressive let's get into a.doorway stretch high so now we're going.to take it up into maybe a little bit.more painful position but if you can.tolerate this it's a little bit more.effective stretch because we're going to.add a rotation component to it as well.so both forearms are up on the doorframe.now as I step into the door I'm getting.a pull through the front of my chest and.the front of my shoulders but then my.arm is also what we'd call externally.rotating so it's rotating kind of my.hand backwards as I'm up in that high.doorway position and so again three.times twenty second holds comfortable.stretch through the front of the chest.through the front of the shoulders is.what we're shooting forward with that.one okay and finally I've got one more.external rotation stretch so I'm just.going to show you right here this is.going to be up in this type of a.position and then we're gonna again.stretch the front of the chest and those.entry.rotators back into this position so to.do that I've got my golf club and what.I'm going to do is grab the handle on my.club and then just hold it behind my.back.and so you'll see I mean all I'm doing.is holding that golf club right here.behind my back now what I'm going to do.so my shoulder is at a ninety degree.from my body my elbow stays at a ninety.degree right here hand is on the handle.with that left hand I'm gonna reach over.and grab the bottom part of the club.down here and then hold on with my right.hand and I'm gonna pull my left hand.forward so right now I'm just pulling my.left hand towards you guys until I get.that external rotation in my shoulder so.the lateral view so I'm right here clubs.back behind me holding on with that.right hand left hand is going to grab.the golf club right down here as I pull.that bottom part of the club.you'll see what that's doing is actually.externally rotating it's taking my ship.my arm back into this position again.that's probably one of the more.aggressive stretches that I show people.but it's also one that is super.effective okay you guys so there you.have an eighth of my favorite stretches.for that shoulder joint and between all.of these that's probably what I.recommend the most often with you know.patients who come in with shoulder pain.who need to be stretched out that.collection or you know certain ones of.those exercises whatever that that.particular patient can tolerate make up.a lot of the home exercise programs that.I recommend for people so I hope that.something I showed you in there was.useful I hope that something in there.helps you out with some of the pain or.tightness that you might be experiencing.if it does you guys be sure to hit that.thumbs up button down below and
