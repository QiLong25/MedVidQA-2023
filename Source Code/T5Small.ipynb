And the difference between the Dick's Hall Pike and and the Epley maneuver is a couple things. We're actually going to bring them down much more quickly to help jar those crystals loose out of the canal. The other important piece of information is we want to be able to maintain that position for at least 30 seconds or until the symptoms start to dissipate. So on the count of three we're going to bring you down really quick. One, two, three. Now with this mistake that therapists make is they will actually maintain the position for 30 seconds but the patient will still have symptoms. You want to make sure that you stay in this position at least 30 seconds but if after 30 seconds they still have spinning, you want to maintain that position until that starts to go away. And then the second position is going to be turning their head rapidly to the opposite side on the count of three. One, two, three. And then 30 seconds later, go ahead and bend your right knee and then roll over onto your left side and you'll tilt their head down towards their left shoulder.

      "  So we've done the Dick's Hall Pike maneuver and let's assume that we triggered symptoms when we had the patient positioned to the right. So now we're going to move into the Epley maneuver to actually treat the symptoms. So what you're going to do is you're going to take the patient and you're going to turn their head 45 degrees towards the side that was triggered, 20 degrees extension, you'll have them hold your arm again. And the difference between the Dick's Hall Pike and and the Epley maneuver is a couple things. We're actually going to bring them down much more quickly to help jar those crystals loose out of the canal. The other important piece of information is we want to be able to maintain that position for at least 30 seconds or until the symptoms start to dissipate. So on the count of three we're going to bring you down really quick. One, two, three. Now with this mistake that therapists make is they will actually maintain the position for 30 seconds but the patient will still have symptoms. You want to make sure that you stay in this position at least 30 seconds but if after 30 seconds they still have spinning, you want to maintain that position until that starts to go away. And then the second position is going to be turning their head rapidly to the opposite side on the count of three. One, two, three. And then 30 seconds later, go ahead and bend your right knee and then roll over onto your left side and you'll tilt their head down towards their left shoulder. And 30 seconds later, you'll have them sit up on the edge of the bed. And maintain their head tilted towards that left side. And 30 seconds later, they'll come up.\n",

      "  roll upon it. So my muscle knot right there on my left side is right about at the top of the glute or the buttock. Take the hand that's closest to the floor right here and just stabilize yourself at the elbow at 90 degrees. Put your arms out, your legs outstretched just like this. The bottom leg, what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring this one up towards the chest while the other one goes straight just like that. You're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to really target it. I'm going to take my hand on the opposite side. I'm going to grab below the knee and I'm going to bring that knee up like this. I'm rotating my left knee towards my right side. This right here really gets that glute to fire and tighten up. You're able just to control how much pressure you're going to be putting from the racquetball into that muscle. Hold this one for about 15 seconds, relax and then repeat this one up to five times or until you feel that muscle knots start to release. If you feel like you need a little bit more of an intense one you can actually lift the leg up completely like this and allow the muscles to completely fire. This one right here is a little bit more advanced. So you just kind of lift it up straight up like this instead of trying to keep the heel on the floor like that. So give those ones a try. Those ones work really well for glute muscle spasms. So the foam roller method is also another good way to get rid of muscle knots over the lower portion of the lower back and into the glutes or buttock. Whatever side that I'm having a lot of muscle spasming or muscle tightness, what I want to do is take that side's leg and put it over the other just like this. Kind of like you're lounging almost. This creates what is known as a figure four stretch. It's really going to help stretch the glute, also the piriformis. And it's another note, if you are dealing with piriformis syndrome, I don't recommend this exercise because it can actually put more pressure into that muscle causing more irritation, possibly onto the sciatic nerve. So if you start to get any symptoms going down the leg that mimic piriformis syndrome, please discontinue this immediately. So getting back to this exercise, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just put my arms back just like this and I'm going to just put my weight onto that side's glued or buttock and then I'm just going to rock back and forth with the foam roller from the lower portion of the lower back all the way down to the butt bone. And what I'm going to do is just go over those muscle spots. Once I find the one that feels very tight I just simply rock on it very slowly for up to 15 seconds. Just take a little bit of a breather and then do that up to three to five times or until you feel that muscle knot start to relax and then you can just simply switch to the other side or just go over different spots as needed. So for this next part we're going to focus more on muscle knots and muscle spasms in the soft tissue around the hip joint. So let's start flat on our back with our knees bent just like this. Let's take our racket ball and place it over the hip where you're having a lot of muscle knots. What I'm going to do then is I'm going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest like this and then I'm going to then roll over the ball until my lower leg makes contact completely with the floor. Let's take the other leg and go completely flat with the foot like this to help stabilize us during this exercise. The bottom arm is going to be outreached just like this for more stabilization. So with this knee bent, what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm able to go. If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going to really feel this. So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds. This is the second part that's going to make it even more intense for those muscle spasms. While the leg is straight, just simply lift it up, I should say the leg up towards the ceiling as far as you're able to go. This should really put a lot of pressure into that muscle knot and hopefully give you a very good self-release or self-massage. Hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. You're then going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest into the starting position, take a little bit of a breather, and then just simply repeat this as many times as needed, usually up to about five times before you feel that muscle knot really start to relax. Then you can just reposition it over a new spot or switch to the other side. This is how we're going to fix muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a foam roller.

      "  Welcome to Ossir and Physio YouTube channel. Today we're going to be looking at the best exercises to deal with acute lower back pain. The first exercise for the acute lower back pain series are knees ways. This is a great exercise if you're finding that you're struggling to move and the back is spasming. What you want to do is lie on your back with a pillow underneath your neck, bringing the knees up and gently allowing the feet to rest on the floor. What we want to aim to do is gently let the knees sway side to side. This is aiming at increasing range of motion and mobility into the lower spine, softening through the postural muscles that have tightened up as well as allowing movement to be reintroduced into the lower spine. We want to aim to do this between one to two minutes. The next exercise are knee hugs. The aim of this exercise is to decompress through the lower spine. Due to the cuteness of the lower back we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the lower back, we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the leg back down. What this is starting to do is decompress and take a little bit of flexion into that lower spine as well as moving through the pelvis. We're aiming to repeat this about 10 to 15 times on each side. Again the range is determined by how it feels. If it's too much bringing the leg up just reduce the range of motion. The next exercise is looking at gentle side bending through the lower spine. The aim of this is to gently allow the body to move side to side. What this is doing is taking the joints and the discs into a side bending motion, while fixing the core nice and tight and stretching up through the body. We want to aim to do this gently each side for about a couple of minutes. If it is tender or painful as you're moving through, you want to continue the movement but you want to reduce the range. Finally we're looking at getting comfortable. This is demonstrating a really nice way to relax when resting with an acute spasm in the lower back. You want to aim to be in sideline position with a pillow between the knees, allowing the body to relax. Finally, walking is absolutely vital for a cute lower spine. This increases movement and allows blood to get into the area to help with recovery.\n"

      " What you want to do is lie on your back with a pillow underneath your neck, bringing the knees up and gently allowing the feet to rest on the floor. What we want to aim to do is gently let the knees sway side to side. This is aiming at increasing range of motion and mobility into the lower spine, softening through the postural muscles that have tightened up as well as allowing movement to be reintroduced into the lower spine. We want to aim to do this between one to two minutes. The next exercise are knee hugs. The aim of this exercise is to decompress through the lower spine. Due to the cuteness of the lower back we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the leg down. What this is starting to do is decompress and take a little bit of flexion into that lower spine as well as well as moving through the pelvis. We're aiming to repeat this about 10 to 15 times on each side. Again the range is determined by how it feels. If it's too much bringing the leg up just reduce the range of motion. The next exercise is looking at gentle side bending through the spine. The aim of this is to gently allow the body to move side to side. What this is doing is taking the joints and the discs into a side bending motion, while fixing the core nice and tight and stretching up through the body. We want to aim to do this gently each side for about a couple of minutes. If it is tender or painful as you're moving through, you want to continue the movement but you want to reduce the range.\n",

      "  I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for Parkview Health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the bleed. Stop the bleed is very simple, three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a tourniquet. So let's start with pressure. If you come upon a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're gonna move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically we could use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze, or you could use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're gonna take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it anymore. And that's getting to the source of the bleeding. So we're going to just keep packing more and more and more. And it could be a deep wound, so don't be afraid. So once we've gotten this completely packed, hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding. So if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a tourniquet, just put the tourniquet on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super super tight. Then we're going to take the handle, we're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it and we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it, and we're going to write the time. For courses in our area, go to Parkview.com and search Stop the Bleed.\n",

      " e better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device it's pretty simple, you first twist this cap off, then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used, pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible so please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on it should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device. I know, I know it's time consuming but remember this, every time you use your lancet the needle becomes dull so one it's going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it adjusts just how deep the lancet tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video, you'll have to do it a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip three, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin. If you're still in pain when you're using this, then speak to your healthcare professional about getting thinner lancets. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring-loaded lancet that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the button so it releases the lancet to puncture your skin for the blood sample. So often I see patients blood glucose meters and their control solution has never even been opened. If you're not testing your machine or your test strips how can you be sure you're getting the right readings? Do you want me to do you next seat? Sure. So tip 4 was meant to be done by Lewis in the last scene, but you couldn't remember his part so I'll just have to do it. So perform a control solution test each time you open a new vial of test strips, or you feel like your meter isn't working properly. Let's say it's giving unexpected results, or you may have dropped it or damaged it. Now I've left more information in the description below about this. So, so, continuing on from our lancing device part, to test our blood glucose we need to get a few things ready. So we need a glucose monitor, it's specific test strips that are in date, a primed and ready to use lancing device which we did earlier, a cotton wool pad, a yellow sharpen and a monitoring diary so we can put our results in at the end. Next, remove a test strip from the vial and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point and warm up and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample. Now word of warning for the next thing, there will be a little bit of blood so if you don't like the sight of blood, skip forward maybe about 30 seconds. I'll put the information in the description too. Now let's do it. Place the Lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture site. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it, make sure your meter is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect a blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or update your electronic records. Tip 5, diabetic patients tend to build up a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're gonna use different machines you're gonna end up with slightly different results and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done. One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and lancets and put them in your yellow shark spin. The safest way to remove your lancet is by placing the lancet cap on a hard surface and pushing the lancet needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on with my guide by leaving a comment below because I'd love to read it. Thanks for watching. Hey guys thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe button now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. Tip 5. That's it. A yellow sharp end and our monitoring diary to input our results in.

      "  So we've done the Dick's Hall Pike maneuver and let's assume that we triggered symptoms when we had the patient positioned to the right. So now we're going to move into the Epley maneuver to actually treat the symptoms. So what you're going to do is you're going to take the patient and you're going to turn their head 45 degrees towards the side that was triggered, 20 degrees extension, you'll have them hold your arm again. And the difference between the Dick's Hall Pike and and the Epley maneuver is a couple things. We're actually going to bring them down much more quickly to help jar those crystals loose out of the canal. The other important piece of information is we want to be able to maintain that position for at least 30 seconds or until the symptoms start to dissipate. So on the count of three we're going to bring you down really quick. One, two, three. Now with this mistake that therapists make is they will actually maintain the position for 30 seconds but the patient will still have symptoms. You want to make sure that you stay in this position at least 30 seconds but if after 30 seconds they still have spinning, you want to maintain that position until that starts to go away. And then the second position is going to be turning their head rapidly to the opposite side on the count of three. One, two, three. And then 30 seconds later, go ahead and bend your right knee and then roll over onto your left side and you'll tilt their head down towards their left shoulder. And 30 seconds later, you'll have them sit up on the edge of the bed. And maintain their head tilted towards that left side. And 30 seconds later, they'll come up.\n"

And the difference between the Dick's Hall Pike and and the Epley maneuver is a couple things. We're actually going to bring them down much more quickly to help jar those crystals loose out of the canal. The other important piece of information is we want to be able to maintain that position for at least 30 seconds or until the symptoms start to dissipate. So on the count of three we're going to bring you down really quick. One, two, three. Now with this mistake that therapists make is they will actually maintain the position for 30 seconds but the patient will still have symptoms. You want to make sure that you stay in this position at least 30 seconds but if after 30 seconds they still have spinning, you want to maintain that position until that starts to go away. And then the second position is going to be turning their head rapidly to the opposite side on the count of three. One, two, three. And then 30 seconds later, go ahead and bend your right knee and then roll over onto your left side and you'll tilt their head down towards their left shoulder. And 30 seconds later, you'll have them sit up on the edge of the bed. And maintain their head tilted towards that left side.\n",

      "  roll upon it. So my muscle knot right there on my left side is right about at the top of the glute or the buttock. Take the hand that's closest to the floor right here and just stabilize yourself at the elbow at 90 degrees. Put your arms out, your legs outstretched just like this. The bottom leg, what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring this one up towards the chest while the other one goes straight just like that. You're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to really target it. I'm going to take my hand on the opposite side. I'm going to grab below the knee and I'm going to bring that knee up like this. I'm rotating my left knee towards my right side. This right here really gets that glute to fire and tighten up. You're able just to control how much pressure you're going to be putting from the racquetball into that muscle. Hold this one for about 15 seconds, relax and then repeat this one up to five times or until you feel that muscle knots start to release. If you feel like you need a little bit more of an intense one you can actually lift the leg up completely like this and allow the muscles to completely fire. This one right here is a little bit more advanced. So you just kind of lift it up straight up like this instead of trying to keep the heel on the floor like that. So give those ones a try. Those ones work really well for glute muscle spasms. So the foam roller method is also another good way to get rid of muscle knots over the lower portion of the lower back and into the glutes or buttock. Whatever side that I'm having a lot of muscle spasming or muscle tightness, what I want to do is take that side's leg and put it over the other just like this. Kind of like you're lounging almost. This creates what is known as a figure four stretch. It's really going to help stretch the glute, also the piriformis. And it's another note, if you are dealing with piriformis syndrome, I don't recommend this exercise because it can actually put more pressure into that muscle causing more irritation, possibly onto the sciatic nerve. So if you start to get any symptoms going down the leg that mimic piriformis syndrome, please discontinue this immediately. So getting back to this exercise, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just put my arms back just like this and I'm going to just put my weight onto that side's glued or buttock and then I'm just going to rock back and forth with the foam roller from the lower portion of the lower back all the way down to the butt bone. And what I'm going to do is just go over those muscle spots. Once I find the one that feels very tight I just simply rock on it very slowly for up to 15 seconds. Just take a little bit of a breather and then do that up to three to five times or until you feel that muscle knot start to relax and then you can just simply switch to the other side or just go over different spots as needed. So for this next part we're going to focus more on muscle knots and muscle spasms in the soft tissue around the hip joint. So let's start flat on our back with our knees bent just like this. Let's take our racket ball and place it over the hip where you're having a lot of muscle knots. What I'm going to do then is I'm going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest like this and then I'm going to then roll over the ball until my lower leg makes contact completely with the floor. Let's take the other leg and go completely flat with the foot like this to help stabilize us during this exercise. The bottom arm is going to be outreached just like this for more stabilization. So with this knee bent, what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm able to go. If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going to really feel this. So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds. This is the second part that's going to make it even more intense for those muscle spasms. While the leg is straight, just simply lift it up, I should say the leg up towards the ceiling as far as you're able to go. This should really put a lot of pressure into that muscle knot and hopefully give you a very good self-release or self-massage. Hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. You're then going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest into the starting position, take a little bit of a breather, and then just simply repeat this as many times as needed, usually up to about five times before you feel that muscle knot really start to relax. Then you can just reposition it over a new spot or switch to the other side. This is how we're going to fix muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a foam roller.

      "  Welcome to Ossir and Physio YouTube channel. Today we're going to be looking at the best exercises to deal with acute lower back pain. The first exercise for the acute lower back pain series are knees ways. This is a great exercise if you're finding that you're struggling to move and the back is spasming. What you want to do is lie on your back with a pillow underneath your neck, bringing the knees up and gently allowing the feet to rest on the floor. What we want to aim to do is gently let the knees sway side to side. This is aiming at increasing range of motion and mobility into the lower spine, softening through the postural muscles that have tightened up as well as allowing movement to be reintroduced into the lower spine. We want to aim to do this between one to two minutes. The next exercise are knee hugs. The aim of this exercise is to decompress through the lower spine. Due to the cuteness of the lower back we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the lower back, we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the leg back down. What this is starting to do is decompress and take a little bit of flexion into that lower spine as well as moving through the pelvis. We're aiming to repeat this about 10 to 15 times on each side. Again the range is determined by how it feels. If it's too much bringing the leg up just reduce the range of motion. The next exercise is looking at gentle side bending through the lower spine. The aim of this is to gently allow the body to move side to side. What this is doing is taking the joints and the discs into a side bending motion, while fixing the core nice and tight and stretching up through the body. We want to aim to do this gently each side for about a couple of minutes. If it is tender or painful as you're moving through, you want to continue the movement but you want to reduce the range. Finally we're looking at getting comfortable. This is demonstrating a really nice way to relax when resting with an acute spasm in the lower back. You want to aim to be in sideline position with a pillow between the knees, allowing the body to relax. Finally, walking is absolutely vital for a cute lower spine. This increases movement and allows blood to get into the area to help with recovery.\n",

      "  I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for Parkview Health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the bleed. Stop the bleed is very simple, three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a tourniquet. So let's start with pressure. If you come upon a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're gonna move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically we could use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze, or you could use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're gonna take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it anymore. And that's getting to the source of the bleeding. So we're going to just keep packing more and more and more. And it could be a deep wound, so don't be afraid. So once we've gotten this completely packed, hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding. So if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a tourniquet, just put the tourniquet on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super super tight. Then we're going to take the handle, we're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it and we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it, and we're going to write the time. For courses in our area, go to Parkview.com and search Stop the Bleed.\n",

      " e better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device it's pretty simple, you first twist this cap off, then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used, pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible so please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on it should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device. I know, I know it's time consuming but remember this, every time you use your lancet the needle becomes dull so one it's going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it adjusts just how deep the lancet tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video, you'll have to do it a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip three, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin. If you're still in pain when you're using this, then speak to your healthcare professional about getting thinner lancets. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring-loaded lancet that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the button so it releases the lancet to puncture your skin for the blood sample. So often I see patients blood glucose meters and their control solution has never even been opened. If you're not testing your machine or your test strips how can you be sure you're getting the right readings? Do you want me to do you next seat? Sure. So tip 4 was meant to be done by Lewis in the last scene, but you couldn't remember his part so I'll just have to do it. So perform a control solution test each time you open a new vial of test strips, or you feel like your meter isn't working properly. Let's say it's giving unexpected results, or you may have dropped it or damaged it. Now I've left more information in the description below about this. So, so, continuing on from our lancing device part, to test our blood glucose we need to get a few things ready. So we need a glucose monitor, it's specific test strips that are in date, a primed and ready to use lancing device which we did earlier, a cotton wool pad, a yellow sharpen and a monitoring diary so we can put our results in at the end. Next, remove a test strip from the vial and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point and warm up and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample. Now word of warning for the next thing, there will be a little bit of blood so if you don't like the sight of blood, skip forward maybe about 30 seconds. I'll put the information in the description too. Now let's do it. Place the Lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture site. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it, make sure your meter is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect a blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or update your electronic records. Tip 5, diabetic patients tend to build up a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're gonna use different machines you're gonna end up with slightly different results and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done. One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and lancets and put them in your yellow shark spin. The safest way to remove your lancet is by placing the lancet cap on a hard surface and pushing the lancet needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on with my guide by leaving a comment below because I'd love to read it. Thanks for watching. Hey guys thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe button now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. Tip 5. That's it. A yellow sharp end and our monitoring diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips, how can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?\n"

      "  roll upon it. So my muscle knot right there on my left side is right about at the top of the glute or the buttock. Take the hand that's closest to the floor right here and just stabilize yourself at the elbow at 90 degrees. Put your arms out, your legs outstretched just like this. The bottom leg, what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring this one up towards the chest while the other one goes straight just like that. You're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to really target it. I'm going to take my hand on the opposite side. I'm going to grab below the knee and I'm going to bring that knee up like this. I'm rotating my left knee towards my right side. This right here really gets that glute to fire and tighten up. You're able just to control how much pressure you're going to be putting from the racquetball into that muscle. Hold this one for about 15 seconds, relax and then repeat this one up to five times or until you feel that muscle knots start to release. If you feel like you need a little bit more of an intense one you can actually lift the leg up completely like this and allow the muscles to completely fire. This one right here is a little bit more advanced. So you just kind of lift it up straight up like this instead of trying to keep the heel on the floor like that. So give those ones a try. Those ones work really well for glute muscle spasms. So the foam roller method is also another good way to get rid of muscle knots over the lower portion of the lower back and into the glutes or buttock. Whatever side that I'm having a lot of muscle spasming or muscle tightness, what I want to do is take that side's leg and put it over the other just like this. Kind of like you're lounging almost. This creates what is known as a figure four stretch. It's really going to help stretch the glute, also the piriformis. And it's another note, if you are dealing with piriformis syndrome, I don't recommend this exercise because it can actually put more pressure into that muscle causing more irritation, possibly onto the sciatic nerve. So if you start to get any symptoms going down the leg that mimic piriformis syndrome, please discontinue this immediately. So getting back to this exercise, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just put my arms back just like this and I'm going to just put my weight onto that side's glued or buttock and then I'm just going to rock back and forth with the foam roller from the lower portion of the lower back all the way down to the butt bone. And what I'm going to do is just go over those muscle spots. Once I find the one that feels very tight I just simply rock on it very slowly for up to 15 seconds. Just take a little bit of a breather and then do that up to three to five times or until you feel that muscle knot start to relax and then you can just simply switch to the other side or just go over different spots as needed. So for this next part we're going to focus more on muscle knots and muscle spasms in the soft tissue around the hip joint. So let's start flat on our back with our knees bent just like this. Let's take our racket ball and place it over the hip where you're having a lot of muscle knots. What I'm going to do then is I'm going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest like this and then I'm going to then roll over the ball until my lower leg makes contact completely with the floor. Let's take the other leg and go completely flat with the foot like this to help stabilize us during this exercise. The bottom arm is going to be outreached just like this for more stabilization. So with this knee bent, what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm able to go. If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going to really feel this. So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds. This is the second part that's going to make it even more intense for those muscle spasms. While the leg is straight, just simply lift it up, I should say the leg up towards the ceiling as far as you're able to go. This should really put a lot of pressure into that muscle knot and hopefully give you a very good self-release or self-massage. Hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. You're then going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest into the starting position, take a little bit of a breather, and then just simply repeat this as many times as needed, usually up to about five times before you feel that muscle knot really start to relax. Then you can just reposition it over a new spot or switch to the other side. This is how we're going to fix muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a foam roller.

      "  Welcome to Ossir and Physio YouTube channel. Today we're going to be looking at the best exercises to deal with acute lower back pain. The first exercise for the acute lower back pain series are knees ways. This is a great exercise if you're finding that you're struggling to move and the back is spasming. What you want to do is lie on your back with a pillow underneath your neck, bringing the knees up and gently allowing the feet to rest on the floor. What we want to aim to do is gently let the knees sway side to side. This is aiming at increasing range of motion and mobility into the lower spine, softening through the postural muscles that have tightened up as well as allowing movement to be reintroduced into the lower spine. We want to aim to do this between one to two minutes. The next exercise are knee hugs. The aim of this exercise is to decompress through the lower spine. Due to the cuteness of the lower back we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the lower back, we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the leg back down. What this is starting to do is decompress and take a little bit of flexion into that lower spine as well as moving through the pelvis. We're aiming to repeat this about 10 to 15 times on each side. Again the range is determined by how it feels. If it's too much bringing the leg up just reduce the range of motion. The next exercise is looking at gentle side bending through the lower spine. The aim of this is to gently allow the body to move side to side. What this is doing is taking the joints and the discs into a side bending motion, while fixing the core nice and tight and stretching up through the body. We want to aim to do this gently each side for about a couple of minutes. If it is tender or painful as you're moving through, you want to continue the movement but you want to reduce the range. Finally we're looking at getting comfortable. This is demonstrating a really nice way to relax when resting with an acute spasm in the lower back. You want to aim to be in sideline position with a pillow between the knees, allowing the body to relax. Finally, walking is absolutely vital for a cute lower spine. This increases movement and allows blood to get into the area to help with recovery.\n",

      "  I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for Parkview Health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the bleed. Stop the bleed is very simple, three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a tourniquet. So let's start with pressure. If you come upon a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're gonna move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically we could use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze, or you could use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're gonna take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it anymore. And that's getting to the source of the bleeding. So we're going to just keep packing more and more and more. And it could be a deep wound, so don't be afraid. So once we've gotten this completely packed, hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding. So if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a tourniquet, just put the tourniquet on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super super tight. Then we're going to take the handle, we're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it and we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it, and we're going to write the time. For courses in our area, go to Parkview.com and search Stop the Bleed.\n",

      " e better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device it's pretty simple, you first twist this cap off, then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used, pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible so please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on it should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device. I know, I know it's time consuming but remember this, every time you use your lancet the needle becomes dull so one it's going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it adjusts just how deep the lancet tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video, you'll have to do it a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip three, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin. If you're still in pain when you're using this, then speak to your healthcare professional about getting thinner lancets. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring-loaded lancet that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the button so it releases the lancet to puncture your skin for the blood sample. So often I see patients blood glucose meters and their control solution has never even been opened. If you're not testing your machine or your test strips how can you be sure you're getting the right readings? Do you want me to do you next seat? Sure. So tip 4 was meant to be done by Lewis in the last scene, but you couldn't remember his part so I'll just have to do it. So perform a control solution test each time you open a new vial of test strips, or you feel like your meter isn't working properly. Let's say it's giving unexpected results, or you may have dropped it or damaged it. Now I've left more information in the description below about this. So, so, continuing on from our lancing device part, to test our blood glucose we need to get a few things ready. So we need a glucose monitor, it's specific test strips that are in date, a primed and ready to use lancing device which we did earlier, a cotton wool pad, a yellow sharpen and a monitoring diary so we can put our results in at the end. Next, remove a test strip from the vial and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point and warm up and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample. Now word of warning for the next thing, there will be a little bit of blood so if you don't like the sight of blood, skip forward maybe about 30 seconds. I'll put the information in the description too. Now let's do it. Place the Lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture site. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it, make sure your meter is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect a blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or update your electronic records. Tip 5, diabetic patients tend to build up a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're gonna use different machines you're gonna end up with slightly different results and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done. One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and lancets and put them in your yellow shark spin. The safest way to remove your lancet is by placing the lancet cap on a hard surface and pushing the lancet needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on with my guide by leaving a comment below because I'd love to read it. Thanks for watching. Hey guys thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe button now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. Tip 5. That's it. A yellow sharp end and our monitoring diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips, how can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?\n"

      "  So we've done the Dick's Hall Pike maneuver and let's assume that we triggered symptoms when we had the patient positioned to the right. So now we're going to move into the Epley maneuver to actually treat the symptoms. So what you're going to do is you're going to take the patient and you're going to turn their head 45 degrees towards the side that was triggered, 20 degrees extension, you'll have them hold your arm again. And the difference between the Dick's Hall Pike and and the Epley maneuver is a couple things. We're actually going to bring them down much more quickly to help jar those crystals loose out of the canal. The other important piece of information is we want to be able to maintain that position for at least 30 seconds or until the symptoms start to dissipate. So on the count of three we're going to bring you down really quick. One, two, three. Now with this mistake that therapists make is they will actually maintain the position for 30 seconds but the patient will still have symptoms. You want to make sure that you stay in this position at least 30 seconds but if after 30 seconds they still have spinning, you want to maintain that position until that starts to go away. And then the second position is going to be turning their head rapidly to the opposite side on the count of three. One, two, three. And then 30 seconds later, go ahead and bend your right knee and then roll over onto your left side and you'll tilt their head down towards their left shoulder. And 30 seconds later, you'll have them sit up on the edge of the bed. And maintain their head tilted towards that left side. And 30 seconds later, they'll come up.\n",

      "  roll upon it. So my muscle knot right there on my left side is right about at the top of the glute or the buttock. Take the hand that's closest to the floor right here and just stabilize yourself at the elbow at 90 degrees. Put your arms out, your legs outstretched just like this. The bottom leg, what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring this one up towards the chest while the other one goes straight just like that. You're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to really target it. I'm going to take my hand on the opposite side. I'm going to grab below the knee and I'm going to bring that knee up like this. I'm rotating my left knee towards my right side. This right here really gets that glute to fire and tighten up. You're able just to control how much pressure you're going to be putting from the racquetball into that muscle. Hold this one for about 15 seconds, relax and then repeat this one up to five times or until you feel that muscle knots start to release. If you feel like you need a little bit more of an intense one you can actually lift the leg up completely like this and allow the muscles to completely fire. This one right here is a little bit more advanced. So you just kind of lift it up straight up like this instead of trying to keep the heel on the floor like that. So give those ones a try. Those ones work really well for glute muscle spasms. So the foam roller method is also another good way to get rid of muscle knots over the lower portion of the lower back and into the glutes or buttock. Whatever side that I'm having a lot of muscle spasming or muscle tightness, what I want to do is take that side's leg and put it over the other just like this. Kind of like you're lounging almost. This creates what is known as a figure four stretch. It's really going to help stretch the glute, also the piriformis. And it's another note, if you are dealing with piriformis syndrome, I don't recommend this exercise because it can actually put more pressure into that muscle causing more irritation, possibly onto the sciatic nerve. So if you start to get any symptoms going down the leg that mimic piriformis syndrome, please discontinue this immediately. So getting back to this exercise, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just put my arms back just like this and I'm going to just put my weight onto that side's glued or buttock and then I'm just going to rock back and forth with the foam roller from the lower portion of the lower back all the way down to the butt bone. And what I'm going to do is just go over those muscle spots. Once I find the one that feels very tight I just simply rock on it very slowly for up to 15 seconds. Just take a little bit of a breather and then do that up to three to five times or until you feel that muscle knot start to relax and then you can just simply switch to the other side or just go over different spots as needed. So for this next part we're going to focus more on muscle knots and muscle spasms in the soft tissue around the hip joint. So let's start flat on our back with our knees bent just like this. Let's take our racket ball and place it over the hip where you're having a lot of muscle knots.

Let's take the other leg and go completely flat with the foot like this to help stabilize us during this exercise. The bottom arm is going to be outreached just like this for more stabilization. So with this knee bent, what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm able to go. If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going to really feel this. So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds. This is the second part that's going to make it even more intense for those muscle spasms. While the leg is straight, just simply lift it up, I should say the leg up towards the ceiling as far as you're able to go. This should really put a lot of pressure into that muscle knot and hopefully give you a very good self-release or self-massage. Hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. You're then going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest into the starting position, take a little bit of a breather, and then just simply repeat this as many times as needed, usually up to about five times before you feel that muscle knot really start to relax. Then you can just reposition it over a new spot or switch to the other side. This is how we're going to fix muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a foam roller.

      "  Welcome to Ossir and Physio YouTube channel. Today we're going to be looking at the best exercises to deal with acute lower back pain. The first exercise for the acute lower back pain series are knees ways. This is a great exercise if you're finding that you're struggling to move and the back is spasming. What you want to do is lie on your back with a pillow underneath your neck, bringing the knees up and gently allowing the feet to rest on the floor. What we want to aim to do is gently let the knees sway side to side. This is aiming at increasing range of motion and mobility into the lower spine, softening through the postural muscles that have tightened up as well as allowing movement to be reintroduced into the lower spine. We want to aim to do this between one to two minutes. The next exercise are knee hugs. The aim of this exercise is to decompress through the lower spine. Due to the cuteness of the lower back we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the lower back, we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the leg back down. What this is starting to do is decompress and take a little bit of flexion into that lower spine as well as moving through the pelvis. We're aiming to repeat this about 10 to 15 times on each side. Again the range is determined by how it feels. If it's too much bringing the leg up just reduce the range of motion. The next exercise is looking at gentle side bending through the lower spine. The aim of this is to gently allow the body to move side to side. What this is doing is taking the joints and the discs into a side bending motion, while fixing the core nice and tight and stretching up through the body. We want to aim to do this gently each side for about a couple of minutes. If it is tender or painful as you're moving through, you want to continue the movement but you want to reduce the range. Finally we're looking at getting comfortable. This is demonstrating a really nice way to relax when resting with an acute spasm in the lower back. You want to aim to be in sideline position with a pillow between the knees, allowing the body to relax. Finally, walking is absolutely vital for a cute lower spine. This increases movement and allows blood to get into the area to help with recovery.\n",

      "  I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for Parkview Health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the bleed. Stop the bleed is very simple, three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a tourniquet. So let's start with pressure. If you come upon a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're gonna move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically we could use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze, or you could use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're gonna take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it anymore. And that's getting to the source of the bleeding. So we're going to just keep packing more and more and more. And it could be a deep wound, so don't be afraid. So once we've gotten this completely packed, hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding. So if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a tourniquet, just put the tourniquet on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super super tight. Then we're going to take the handle, we're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it and we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it, and we're going to write the time. For courses in our area, go to Parkview.com and search Stop the Bleed.\n",

      " e better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device it's pretty simple, you first twist this cap off, then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used, pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible so please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on it should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device. I know, I know it's time consuming but remember this, every time you use your lancet the needle becomes dull so one it's going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it adjusts just how deep the lancet tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video, you'll have to do it a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip three, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin. If you're still in pain when you're using this, then speak to your healthcare professional about getting thinner lancets. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring-loaded lancet that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the button so it releases the lancet to puncture your skin for the blood sample. So often I see patients blood glucose meters and their control solution has never even been opened. If you're not testing your machine or your test strips how can you be sure you're getting the right readings? Do you want me to do you next seat? Sure. So tip 4 was meant to be done by Lewis in the last scene, but you couldn't remember his part so I'll just have to do it. So perform a control solution test each time you open a new vial of test strips, or you feel like your meter isn't working properly. Let's say it's giving unexpected results, or you may have dropped it or damaged it. Now I've left more information in the description below about this. So, so, continuing on from our lancing device part, to test our blood glucose we need to get a few things ready. So we need a glucose monitor, it's specific test strips that are in date, a primed and ready to use lancing device which we did earlier, a cotton wool pad, a yellow sharpen and a monitoring diary so we can put our results in at the end. Next, remove a test strip from the vial and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point and warm up and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample. Now word of warning for the next thing, there will be a little bit of blood so if you don't like the sight of blood, skip forward maybe about 30 seconds. I'll put the information in the description too. Now let's do it. Place the Lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture site. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it, make sure your meter is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect a blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or update your electronic records. Tip 5, diabetic patients tend to build up a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're gonna use different machines you're gonna end up with slightly different results and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done. One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and lancets and put them in your yellow shark spin. The safest way to remove your lancet is by placing the lancet cap on a hard surface and pushing the lancet needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on with my guide by leaving a comment below because I'd love to read it. Thanks for watching. Hey guys thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe button now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. Tip 5. That's it. A yellow sharp end and our monitoring diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips, how can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?\n"

      "  So we've done the Dick's Hall Pike maneuver and let's assume that we triggered symptoms when we had the patient positioned to the right. So now we're going to move into the Epley maneuver to actually treat the symptoms. So what you're going to do is you're going to take the patient and you're going to turn their head 45 degrees towards the side that was triggered, 20 degrees extension, you'll have them hold your arm again. And the difference between the Dick's Hall Pike and and the Epley maneuver is a couple things. We're actually going to bring them down much more quickly to help jar those crystals loose out of the canal. The other important piece of information is we want to be able to maintain that position for at least 30 seconds or until the symptoms start to dissipate. So on the count of three we're going to bring you down really quick. One, two, three. Now with this mistake that therapists make is they will actually maintain the position for 30 seconds but the patient will still have symptoms. You want to make sure that you stay in this position at least 30 seconds but if after 30 seconds they still have spinning, you want to maintain that position until that starts to go away. And then the second position is going to be turning their head rapidly to the opposite side on the count of three. One, two, three. And then 30 seconds later, go ahead and bend your right knee and then roll over onto your left side and you'll tilt their head down towards their left shoulder. And 30 seconds later, you'll have them sit up on the edge of the bed. And maintain their head tilted towards that left side. And 30 seconds later, they'll come up.\n",

      "  roll upon it. So my muscle knot right there on my left side is right about at the top of the glute or the buttock. Take the hand that's closest to the floor right here and just stabilize yourself at the elbow at 90 degrees. Put your arms out, your legs outstretched just like this. The bottom leg, what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring this one up towards the chest while the other one goes straight just like that. You're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to really target it. I'm going to take my hand on the opposite side. I'm going to grab below the knee and I'm going to bring that knee up like this. I'm rotating my left knee towards my right side. This right here really gets that glute to fire and tighten up. You're able just to control how much pressure you're going to be putting from the racquetball into that muscle. Hold this one for about 15 seconds, relax and then repeat this one up to five times or until you feel that muscle knots start to release. If you feel like you need a little bit more of an intense one you can actually lift the leg up completely like this and allow the muscles to completely fire. This one right here is a little bit more advanced. So you just kind of lift it up straight up like this instead of trying to keep the heel on the floor like that. So give those ones a try. Those ones work really well for glute muscle spasms. So the foam roller method is also another good way to get rid of muscle knots over the lower portion of the lower back and into the glutes or buttock. Whatever side that I'm having a lot of muscle spasming or muscle tightness, what I want to do is take that side's leg and put it over the other just like this. Kind of like you're lounging almost. This creates what is known as a figure four stretch. It's really going to help stretch the glute, also the piriformis. And it's another note, if you are dealing with piriformis syndrome, I don't recommend this exercise because it can actually put more pressure into that muscle causing more irritation, possibly onto the sciatic nerve. So if you start to get any symptoms going down the leg that mimic piriformis syndrome, please discontinue this immediately. So getting back to this exercise, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just put my arms back just like this and I'm going to just put my weight onto that side's glued or buttock and then I'm just going to rock back and forth with the foam roller from the lower portion of the lower back all the way down to the butt bone. And what I'm going to do is just go over those muscle spots. Once I find the one that feels very tight I just simply rock on it very slowly for up to 15 seconds. Just take a little bit of a breather and then do that up to three to five times or until you feel that muscle knot start to relax and then you can just simply switch to the other side or just go over different spots as needed. So for this next part we're going to focus more on muscle knots and muscle spasms in the soft tissue around the hip joint. So let's start flat on our back with our knees bent just like this. Let's take our racket ball and place it over the hip where you're having a lot of muscle knots. What I'm going to do then is I'm going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest like this and then I'm going to then roll over the ball until my lower leg makes contact completely with the floor. Let's take the other leg and go completely flat with the foot like this to help stabilize us during this exercise. The bottom arm is going to be outreached just like this for more stabilization. So with this knee bent, what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm able to go. If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going to really feel this. So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds. This is the second part that's going to make it even more intense for those muscle spasms. While the leg is straight, just simply lift it up, I should say the leg up towards the ceiling as far as you're able to go. This should really put a lot of pressure into that muscle knot and hopefully give you a very good self-release or self-massage. Hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. You're then going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest into the starting position, take a little bit of a breather, and then just simply repeat this as many times as needed, usually up to about five times before you feel that muscle knot really start to relax. Then you can just reposition it over a new spot or switch to the other side. This is how we're going to fix muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a foam roller.

So with this knee bent, what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm able to go. If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going to really feel this. So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds. This is the second part that's going to make it even more intense for those muscle spasms. While the leg is straight, just simply lift it up, I should say the leg up towards the ceiling as far as you're able to go. This should really put a lot of pressure into that muscle knot and hopefully give you a very good self-release or self-massage. Hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. You're then going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest into the starting position, take a little bit of a breather, and then just simply repeat this as many times as needed, usually up to about five times before you feel that muscle knot really start to relax.\n",

      "  Welcome to Ossir and Physio YouTube channel. Today we're going to be looking at the best exercises to deal with acute lower back pain. The first exercise for the acute lower back pain series are knees ways. This is a great exercise if you're finding that you're struggling to move and the back is spasming. What you want to do is lie on your back with a pillow underneath your neck, bringing the knees up and gently allowing the feet to rest on the floor. What we want to aim to do is gently let the knees sway side to side. This is aiming at increasing range of motion and mobility into the lower spine, softening through the postural muscles that have tightened up as well as allowing movement to be reintroduced into the lower spine. We want to aim to do this between one to two minutes. The next exercise are knee hugs. The aim of this exercise is to decompress through the lower spine. Due to the cuteness of the lower back we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the lower back, we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the leg back down. What this is starting to do is decompress and take a little bit of flexion into that lower spine as well as moving through the pelvis. We're aiming to repeat this about 10 to 15 times on each side. Again the range is determined by how it feels. If it's too much bringing the leg up just reduce the range of motion. The next exercise is looking at gentle side bending through the lower spine. The aim of this is to gently allow the body to move side to side. What this is doing is taking the joints and the discs into a side bending motion, while fixing the core nice and tight and stretching up through the body. We want to aim to do this gently each side for about a couple of minutes. If it is tender or painful as you're moving through, you want to continue the movement but you want to reduce the range. Finally we're looking at getting comfortable. This is demonstrating a really nice way to relax when resting with an acute spasm in the lower back. You want to aim to be in sideline position with a pillow between the knees, allowing the body to relax. Finally, walking is absolutely vital for a cute lower spine. This increases movement and allows blood to get into the area to help with recovery.\n",

      "  I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for Parkview Health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the bleed. Stop the bleed is very simple, three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a tourniquet. So let's start with pressure. If you come upon a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're gonna move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically we could use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze, or you could use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're gonna take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it anymore. And that's getting to the source of the bleeding. So we're going to just keep packing more and more and more. And it could be a deep wound, so don't be afraid. So once we've gotten this completely packed, hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding. So if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a tourniquet, just put the tourniquet on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super super tight. Then we're going to take the handle, we're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it and we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it, and we're going to write the time. For courses in our area, go to Parkview.com and search Stop the Bleed.\n",

      " e better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device it's pretty simple, you first twist this cap off, then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used, pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible so please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on it should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device. I know, I know it's time consuming but remember this, every time you use your lancet the needle becomes dull so one it's going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it adjusts just how deep the lancet tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video, you'll have to do it a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip three, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin. If you're still in pain when you're using this, then speak to your healthcare professional about getting thinner lancets. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring-loaded lancet that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the button so it releases the lancet to puncture your skin for the blood sample. So often I see patients blood glucose meters and their control solution has never even been opened. If you're not testing your machine or your test strips how can you be sure you're getting the right readings? Do you want me to do you next seat? Sure. So tip 4 was meant to be done by Lewis in the last scene, but you couldn't remember his part so I'll just have to do it. So perform a control solution test each time you open a new vial of test strips, or you feel like your meter isn't working properly. Let's say it's giving unexpected results, or you may have dropped it or damaged it. Now I've left more information in the description below about this. So, so, continuing on from our lancing device part, to test our blood glucose we need to get a few things ready. So we need a glucose monitor, it's specific test strips that are in date, a primed and ready to use lancing device which we did earlier, a cotton wool pad, a yellow sharpen and a monitoring diary so we can put our results in at the end. Next, remove a test strip from the vial and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point and warm up and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample. Now word of warning for the next thing, there will be a little bit of blood so if you don't like the sight of blood, skip forward maybe about 30 seconds. I'll put the information in the description too. Now let's do it. Place the Lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture site. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it, make sure your meter is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect a blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or update your electronic records. Tip 5, diabetic patients tend to build up a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're gonna use different machines you're gonna end up with slightly different results and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done. One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and lancets and put them in your yellow shark spin. The safest way to remove your lancet is by placing the lancet cap on a hard surface and pushing the lancet needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on with my guide by leaving a comment below because I'd love to read it. Thanks for watching. Hey guys thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe button now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. Tip 5. That's it. A yellow sharp end and our monitoring diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips, how can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?\n"

      "  So we've done the Dick's Hall Pike maneuver and let's assume that we triggered symptoms when we had the patient positioned to the right. So now we're going to move into the Epley maneuver to actually treat the symptoms. So what you're going to do is you're going to take the patient and you're going to turn their head 45 degrees towards the side that was triggered, 20 degrees extension, you'll have them hold your arm again. And the difference between the Dick's Hall Pike and and the Epley maneuver is a couple things. We're actually going to bring them down much more quickly to help jar those crystals loose out of the canal. The other important piece of information is we want to be able to maintain that position for at least 30 seconds or until the symptoms start to dissipate. So on the count of three we're going to bring you down really quick. One, two, three. Now with this mistake that therapists make is they will actually maintain the position for 30 seconds but the patient will still have symptoms. You want to make sure that you stay in this position at least 30 seconds but if after 30 seconds they still have spinning, you want to maintain that position until that starts to go away. And then the second position is going to be turning their head rapidly to the opposite side on the count of three. One, two, three. And then 30 seconds later, go ahead and bend your right knee and then roll over onto your left side and you'll tilt their head down towards their left shoulder. And 30 seconds later, you'll have them sit up on the edge of the bed. And maintain their head tilted towards that left side. And 30 seconds later, they'll come up.\n",

      "  roll upon it. So my muscle knot right there on my left side is right about at the top of the glute or the buttock. Take the hand that's closest to the floor right here and just stabilize yourself at the elbow at 90 degrees. Put your arms out, your legs outstretched just like this. The bottom leg, what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring this one up towards the chest while the other one goes straight just like that. You're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to really target it. I'm going to take my hand on the opposite side. I'm going to grab below the knee and I'm going to bring that knee up like this. I'm rotating my left knee towards my right side. This right here really gets that glute to fire and tighten up. You're able just to control how much pressure you're going to be putting from the racquetball into that muscle. Hold this one for about 15 seconds, relax and then repeat this one up to five times or until you feel that muscle knots start to release. If you feel like you need a little bit more of an intense one you can actually lift the leg up completely like this and allow the muscles to completely fire. This one right here is a little bit more advanced. So you just kind of lift it up straight up like this instead of trying to keep the heel on the floor like that. So give those ones a try. Those ones work really well for glute muscle spasms. So the foam roller method is also another good way to get rid of muscle knots over the lower portion of the lower back and into the glutes or buttock. Whatever side that I'm having a lot of muscle spasming or muscle tightness, what I want to do is take that side's leg and put it over the other just like this. Kind of like you're lounging almost. This creates what is known as a figure four stretch. It's really going to help stretch the glute, also the piriformis. And it's another note, if you are dealing with piriformis syndrome, I don't recommend this exercise because it can actually put more pressure into that muscle causing more irritation, possibly onto the sciatic nerve. So if you start to get any symptoms going down the leg that mimic piriformis syndrome, please discontinue this immediately. So getting back to this exercise, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just put my arms back just like this and I'm going to just put my weight onto that side's glued or buttock and then I'm just going to rock back and forth with the foam roller from the lower portion of the lower back all the way down to the butt bone. And what I'm going to do is just go over those muscle spots. Once I find the one that feels very tight I just simply rock on it very slowly for up to 15 seconds. Just take a little bit of a breather and then do that up to three to five times or until you feel that muscle knot start to relax and then you can just simply switch to the other side or just go over different spots as needed. So for this next part we're going to focus more on muscle knots and muscle spasms in the soft tissue around the hip joint. So let's start flat on our back with our knees bent just like this. Let's take our racket ball and place it over the hip where you're having a lot of muscle knots. What I'm going to do then is I'm going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest like this and then I'm going to then roll over the ball until my lower leg makes contact completely with the floor. Let's take the other leg and go completely flat with the foot like this to help stabilize us during this exercise. The bottom arm is going to be outreached just like this for more stabilization. So with this knee bent, what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm able to go. If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going to really feel this. So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds.

Then you can just reposition it over a new spot or switch to the other side. This is how we're going to fix muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a foam roller.

If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're gonna move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically we could use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze, or you could use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're gonna take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it anymore. And that's getting to the source of the bleeding. So we're going to just keep packing more and more and more. And it could be a deep wound, so don't be afraid. So once we've gotten this completely packed, hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding. So if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a tourniquet, just put the tourniquet on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super super tight. Then we're going to take the handle, we're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it and we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it, and we're going to write the time.

      " e better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device it's pretty simple, you first twist this cap off, then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used, pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible so please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on it should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device. I know, I know it's time consuming but remember this, every time you use your lancet the needle becomes dull so one it's going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it adjusts just how deep the lancet tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video, you'll have to do it a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip three, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin. If you're still in pain when you're using this, then speak to your healthcare professional about getting thinner lancets. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring-loaded lancet that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the button so it releases the lancet to puncture your skin for the blood sample. So often I see patients blood glucose meters and their control solution has never even been opened. If you're not testing your machine or your test strips how can you be sure you're getting the right readings? Do you want me to do you next seat? Sure. So tip 4 was meant to be done by Lewis in the last scene, but you couldn't remember his part so I'll just have to do it. So perform a control solution test each time you open a new vial of test strips, or you feel like your meter isn't working properly. Let's say it's giving unexpected results, or you may have dropped it or damaged it. Now I've left more information in the description below about this. So, so, continuing on from our lancing device part, to test our blood glucose we need to get a few things ready. So we need a glucose monitor, it's specific test strips that are in date, a primed and ready to use lancing device which we did earlier, a cotton wool pad, a yellow sharpen and a monitoring diary so we can put our results in at the end. Next, remove a test strip from the vial and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point and warm up and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample. Now word of warning for the next thing, there will be a little bit of blood so if you don't like the sight of blood, skip forward maybe about 30 seconds. I'll put the information in the description too. Now let's do it. Place the Lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture site. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it, make sure your meter is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect a blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or update your electronic records. Tip 5, diabetic patients tend to build up a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're gonna use different machines you're gonna end up with slightly different results and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done. One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and lancets and put them in your yellow shark spin. The safest way to remove your lancet is by placing the lancet cap on a hard surface and pushing the lancet needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on with my guide by leaving a comment below because I'd love to read it. Thanks for watching. Hey guys thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe button now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. Tip 5. That's it. A yellow sharp end and our monitoring diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips, how can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?\n",

      "  So we've done the Dick's Hall Pike maneuver and let's assume that we triggered symptoms when we had the patient positioned to the right. So now we're going to move into the Epley maneuver to actually treat the symptoms. So what you're going to do is you're going to take the patient and you're going to turn their head 45 degrees towards the side that was triggered, 20 degrees extension, you'll have them hold your arm again. And the difference between the Dick's Hall Pike and and the Epley maneuver is a couple things. We're actually going to bring them down much more quickly to help jar those crystals loose out of the canal. The other important piece of information is we want to be able to maintain that position for at least 30 seconds or until the symptoms start to dissipate. So on the count of three we're going to bring you down really quick. One, two, three. Now with this mistake that therapists make is they will actually maintain the position for 30 seconds but the patient will still have symptoms. You want to make sure that you stay in this position at least 30 seconds but if after 30 seconds they still have spinning, you want to maintain that position until that starts to go away. And then the second position is going to be turning their head rapidly to the opposite side on the count of three. One, two, three. And then 30 seconds later, go ahead and bend your right knee and then roll over onto your left side and you'll tilt their head down towards their left shoulder. And 30 seconds later, you'll have them sit up on the edge of the bed. And maintain their head tilted towards that left side. And 30 seconds later, they'll come up.\n"

      "  roll upon it. So my muscle knot right there on my left side is right about at the top of the glute or the buttock. Take the hand that's closest to the floor right here and just stabilize yourself at the elbow at 90 degrees. Put your arms out, your legs outstretched just like this. The bottom leg, what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring this one up towards the chest while the other one goes straight just like that. You're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to really target it. I'm going to take my hand on the opposite side. I'm going to grab below the knee and I'm going to bring that knee up like this. I'm rotating my left knee towards my right side. This right here really gets that glute to fire and tighten up. You're able just to control how much pressure you're going to be putting from the racquetball into that muscle. Hold this one for about 15 seconds, relax and then repeat this one up to five times or until you feel that muscle knots start to release. If you feel like you need a little bit more of an intense one you can actually lift the leg up completely like this and allow the muscles to completely fire. This one right here is a little bit more advanced. So you just kind of lift it up straight up like this instead of trying to keep the heel on the floor like that. So give those ones a try. Those ones work really well for glute muscle spasms. So the foam roller method is also another good way to get rid of muscle knots over the lower portion of the lower back and into the glutes or buttock. Whatever side that I'm having a lot of muscle spasming or muscle tightness, what I want to do is take that side's leg and put it over the other just like this. Kind of like you're lounging almost. This creates what is known as a figure four stretch. It's really going to help stretch the glute, also the piriformis. And it's another note, if you are dealing with piriformis syndrome, I don't recommend this exercise because it can actually put more pressure into that muscle causing more irritation, possibly onto the sciatic nerve. So if you start to get any symptoms going down the leg that mimic piriformis syndrome, please discontinue this immediately. So getting back to this exercise, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just put my arms back just like this and I'm going to just put my weight onto that side's glued or buttock and then I'm just going to rock back and forth with the foam roller from the lower portion of the lower back all the way down to the butt bone. And what I'm going to do is just go over those muscle spots. Once I find the one that feels very tight I just simply rock on it very slowly for up to 15 seconds. Just take a little bit of a breather and then do that up to three to five times or until you feel that muscle knot start to relax and then you can just simply switch to the other side or just go over different spots as needed. So for this next part we're going to focus more on muscle knots and muscle spasms in the soft tissue around the hip joint. So let's start flat on our back with our knees bent just like this. Let's take our racket ball and place it over the hip where you're having a lot of muscle knots. What I'm going to do then is I'm going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest like this and then I'm going to then roll over the ball until my lower leg makes contact completely with the floor. Let's take the other leg and go completely flat with the foot like this to help stabilize us during this exercise. The bottom arm is going to be outreached just like this for more stabilization. So with this knee bent, what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm able to go. If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going to really feel this. So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds. This is the second part that's going to make it even more intense for those muscle spasms. While the leg is straight, just simply lift it up, I should say the leg up towards the ceiling as far as you're able to go. This should really put a lot of pressure into that muscle knot and hopefully give you a very good self-release or self-massage. Hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. You're then going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest into the starting position, take a little bit of a breather, and then just simply repeat this as many times as needed, usually up to about five times before you feel that muscle knot really start to relax. Then you can just reposition it over a new spot or switch to the other side. This is how we're going to fix muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a foam roller.

      "  Welcome to Ossir and Physio YouTube channel. Today we're going to be looking at the best exercises to deal with acute lower back pain. The first exercise for the acute lower back pain series are knees ways. This is a great exercise if you're finding that you're struggling to move and the back is spasming. What you want to do is lie on your back with a pillow underneath your neck, bringing the knees up and gently allowing the feet to rest on the floor. What we want to aim to do is gently let the knees sway side to side. This is aiming at increasing range of motion and mobility into the lower spine, softening through the postural muscles that have tightened up as well as allowing movement to be reintroduced into the lower spine. We want to aim to do this between one to two minutes. The next exercise are knee hugs. The aim of this exercise is to decompress through the lower spine. Due to the cuteness of the lower back we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the lower back, we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the leg back down. What this is starting to do is decompress and take a little bit of flexion into that lower spine as well as moving through the pelvis. We're aiming to repeat this about 10 to 15 times on each side. Again the range is determined by how it feels. If it's too much bringing the leg up just reduce the range of motion. The next exercise is looking at gentle side bending through the lower spine. The aim of this is to gently allow the body to move side to side. What this is doing is taking the joints and the discs into a side bending motion, while fixing the core nice and tight and stretching up through the body. We want to aim to do this gently each side for about a couple of minutes. If it is tender or painful as you're moving through, you want to continue the movement but you want to reduce the range. Finally we're looking at getting comfortable. This is demonstrating a really nice way to relax when resting with an acute spasm in the lower back. You want to aim to be in sideline position with a pillow between the knees, allowing the body to relax. Finally, walking is absolutely vital for a cute lower spine. This increases movement and allows blood to get into the area to help with recovery.\n",

      "  I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for Parkview Health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the bleed. Stop the bleed is very simple, three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a tourniquet. So let's start with pressure. If you come upon a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're gonna move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically we could use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze, or you could use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're gonna take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it anymore. And that's getting to the source of the bleeding. So we're going to just keep packing more and more and more. And it could be a deep wound, so don't be afraid. So once we've gotten this completely packed, hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding. So if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a tourniquet, just put the tourniquet on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super super tight. Then we're going to take the handle, we're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it and we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it, and we're going to write the time.

Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible so please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on it should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device.

Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video, you'll have to do it a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip three, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin. If you're still in pain when you're using this, then speak to your healthcare professional about getting thinner lancets. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring-loaded lancet that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the button so it releases the lancet to puncture your skin for the blood sample. So often I see patients blood glucose meters and their control solution has never even been opened. If you're not testing your machine or your test strips how can you be sure you're getting the right readings? Do you want me to do you next seat? Sure. So tip 4 was meant to be done by Lewis in the last scene, but you couldn't remember his part so I'll just have to do it. So perform a control solution test each time you open a new vial of test strips, or you feel like your meter isn't working properly. Let's say it's giving unexpected results, or you may have dropped it or damaged it. Now I've left more information in the description below about this. So, so, continuing on from our lancing device part, to test our blood glucose we need to get a few things ready. So we need a glucose monitor, it's specific test strips that are in date, a primed and ready to use lancing device which we did earlier, a cotton wool pad, a yellow sharpen and a monitoring diary so we can put our results in at the end. Next, remove a test strip from the vial and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point and warm up and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample. Now word of warning for the next thing, there will be a little bit of blood so if you don't like the sight of blood, skip forward maybe about 30 seconds. I'll put the information in the description too. Now let's do it. Place the Lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture site. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it, make sure your meter is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect a blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or update your electronic records. Tip 5, diabetic patients tend to build up a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're gonna use different machines you're gonna end up with slightly different results and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done. One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and lancets and put them in your yellow shark spin. The safest way to remove your lancet is by placing the lancet cap on a hard surface and pushing the lancet needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on with my guide by leaving a comment below because I'd love to read it. Thanks for watching. Hey guys thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe button now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. Tip 5. That's it. A yellow sharp end and our monitoring diary to input our results in.

      "  So we've done the Dick's Hall Pike maneuver and let's assume that we triggered symptoms when we had the patient positioned to the right. So now we're going to move into the Epley maneuver to actually treat the symptoms. So what you're going to do is you're going to take the patient and you're going to turn their head 45 degrees towards the side that was triggered, 20 degrees extension, you'll have them hold your arm again. And the difference between the Dick's Hall Pike and and the Epley maneuver is a couple things. We're actually going to bring them down much more quickly to help jar those crystals loose out of the canal. The other important piece of information is we want to be able to maintain that position for at least 30 seconds or until the symptoms start to dissipate. So on the count of three we're going to bring you down really quick. One, two, three. Now with this mistake that therapists make is they will actually maintain the position for 30 seconds but the patient will still have symptoms. You want to make sure that you stay in this position at least 30 seconds but if after 30 seconds they still have spinning, you want to maintain that position until that starts to go away. And then the second position is going to be turning their head rapidly to the opposite side on the count of three. One, two, three. And then 30 seconds later, go ahead and bend your right knee and then roll over onto your left side and you'll tilt their head down towards their left shoulder. And 30 seconds later, you'll have them sit up on the edge of the bed. And maintain their head tilted towards that left side. And 30 seconds later, they'll come up.\n",

      "  roll upon it. So my muscle knot right there on my left side is right about at the top of the glute or the buttock. Take the hand that's closest to the floor right here and just stabilize yourself at the elbow at 90 degrees. Put your arms out, your legs outstretched just like this. The bottom leg, what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring this one up towards the chest while the other one goes straight just like that. You're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to really target it. I'm going to take my hand on the opposite side. I'm going to grab below the knee and I'm going to bring that knee up like this. I'm rotating my left knee towards my right side. This right here really gets that glute to fire and tighten up. You're able just to control how much pressure you're going to be putting from the racquetball into that muscle. Hold this one for about 15 seconds, relax and then repeat this one up to five times or until you feel that muscle knots start to release. If you feel like you need a little bit more of an intense one you can actually lift the leg up completely like this and allow the muscles to completely fire. This one right here is a little bit more advanced. So you just kind of lift it up straight up like this instead of trying to keep the heel on the floor like that. So give those ones a try. Those ones work really well for glute muscle spasms. So the foam roller method is also another good way to get rid of muscle knots over the lower portion of the lower back and into the glutes or buttock. Whatever side that I'm having a lot of muscle spasming or muscle tightness, what I want to do is take that side's leg and put it over the other just like this. Kind of like you're lounging almost. This creates what is known as a figure four stretch. It's really going to help stretch the glute, also the piriformis. And it's another note, if you are dealing with piriformis syndrome, I don't recommend this exercise because it can actually put more pressure into that muscle causing more irritation, possibly onto the sciatic nerve. So if you start to get any symptoms going down the leg that mimic piriformis syndrome, please discontinue this immediately. So getting back to this exercise, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just put my arms back just like this and I'm going to just put my weight onto that side's glued or buttock and then I'm just going to rock back and forth with the foam roller from the lower portion of the lower back all the way down to the butt bone. And what I'm going to do is just go over those muscle spots. Once I find the one that feels very tight I just simply rock on it very slowly for up to 15 seconds. Just take a little bit of a breather and then do that up to three to five times or until you feel that muscle knot start to relax and then you can just simply switch to the other side or just go over different spots as needed. So for this next part we're going to focus more on muscle knots and muscle spasms in the soft tissue around the hip joint. So let's start flat on our back with our knees bent just like this. Let's take our racket ball and place it over the hip where you're having a lot of muscle knots. What I'm going to do then is I'm going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest like this and then I'm going to then roll over the ball until my lower leg makes contact completely with the floor. Let's take the other leg and go completely flat with the foot like this to help stabilize us during this exercise. The bottom arm is going to be outreached just like this for more stabilization. So with this knee bent, what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm able to go. If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going to really feel this. So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds. This is the second part that's going to make it even more intense for those muscle spasms. While the leg is straight, just simply lift it up, I should say the leg up towards the ceiling as far as you're able to go. This should really put a lot of pressure into that muscle knot and hopefully give you a very good self-release or self-massage. Hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. You're then going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest into the starting position, take a little bit of a breather, and then just simply repeat this as many times as needed, usually up to about five times before you feel that muscle knot really start to relax. Then you can just reposition it over a new spot or switch to the other side. This is how we're going to fix muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a foam roller. Go to the side that you are looking to target those muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a f\n"

      "  Welcome to Ossir and Physio YouTube channel. Today we're going to be looking at the best exercises to deal with acute lower back pain. The first exercise for the acute lower back pain series are knees ways. This is a great exercise if you're finding that you're struggling to move and the back is spasming. What you want to do is lie on your back with a pillow underneath your neck, bringing the knees up and gently allowing the feet to rest on the floor. What we want to aim to do is gently let the knees sway side to side. This is aiming at increasing range of motion and mobility into the lower spine, softening through the postural muscles that have tightened up as well as allowing movement to be reintroduced into the lower spine. We want to aim to do this between one to two minutes. The next exercise are knee hugs. The aim of this exercise is to decompress through the lower spine. Due to the cuteness of the lower back we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the lower back, we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the leg back down. What this is starting to do is decompress and take a little bit of flexion into that lower spine as well as moving through the pelvis. We're aiming to repeat this about 10 to 15 times on each side. Again the range is determined by how it feels. If it's too much bringing the leg up just reduce the range of motion. The next exercise is looking at gentle side bending through the lower spine. The aim of this is to gently allow the body to move side to side. What this is doing is taking the joints and the discs into a side bending motion, while fixing the core nice and tight and stretching up through the body. We want to aim to do this gently each side for about a couple of minutes. If it is tender or painful as you're moving through, you want to continue the movement but you want to reduce the range. Finally we're looking at getting comfortable. This is demonstrating a really nice way to relax when resting with an acute spasm in the lower back. You want to aim to be in sideline position with a pillow between the knees, allowing the body to relax. Finally, walking is absolutely vital for a cute lower spine. This increases movement and allows blood to get into the area to help with recovery.\n",

      "  I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for Parkview Health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the bleed. Stop the bleed is very simple, three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a tourniquet. So let's start with pressure. If you come upon a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're gonna move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically we could use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze, or you could use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're gonna take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it anymore. And that's getting to the source of the bleeding. So we're going to just keep packing more and more and more. And it could be a deep wound, so don't be afraid. So once we've gotten this completely packed, hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding. So if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a tourniquet, just put the tourniquet on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super super tight. Then we're going to take the handle, we're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it and we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it, and we're going to write the time. For courses in our area, go to Parkview.com and search Stop the Bleed.\n",

      " e better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device it's pretty simple, you first twist this cap off, then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used, pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible so please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on it should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device. I know, I know it's time consuming but remember this, every time you use your lancet the needle becomes dull so one it's going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it adjusts just how deep the lancet tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video, you'll have to do it a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip three, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin.

And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring-loaded lancet that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the button so it releases the lancet to puncture your skin for the blood sample. So often I see patients blood glucose meters and their control solution has never even been opened. If you're not testing your machine or your test strips how can you be sure you're getting the right readings? Do you want me to do you next seat? Sure.

I'll put the information in the description too. Now let's do it. Place the Lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture site. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it, make sure your meter is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect a blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or update your electronic records.

      "  So we've done the Dick's Hall Pike maneuver and let's assume that we triggered symptoms when we had the patient positioned to the right. So now we're going to move into the Epley maneuver to actually treat the symptoms. So what you're going to do is you're going to take the patient and you're going to turn their head 45 degrees towards the side that was triggered, 20 degrees extension, you'll have them hold your arm again. And the difference between the Dick's Hall Pike and and the Epley maneuver is a couple things. We're actually going to bring them down much more quickly to help jar those crystals loose out of the canal. The other important piece of information is we want to be able to maintain that position for at least 30 seconds or until the symptoms start to dissipate. So on the count of three we're going to bring you down really quick. One, two, three. Now with this mistake that therapists make is they will actually maintain the position for 30 seconds but the patient will still have symptoms. You want to make sure that you stay in this position at least 30 seconds but if after 30 seconds they still have spinning, you want to maintain that position until that starts to go away. And then the second position is going to be turning their head rapidly to the opposite side on the count of three. One, two, three. And then 30 seconds later, go ahead and bend your right knee and then roll over onto your left side and you'll tilt their head down towards their left shoulder. And 30 seconds later, you'll have them sit up on the edge of the bed. And maintain their head tilted towards that left side. And 30 seconds later, they'll come up.\n"

Take the hand that's closest to the floor right here and just stabilize yourself at the elbow at 90 degrees. Put your arms out, your legs outstretched just like this. The bottom leg, what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring this one up towards the chest while the other one goes straight just like that. You're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to really target it. I'm going to take my hand on the opposite side. I'm going to grab below the knee and I'm going to bring that knee up like this. I'm rotating my left knee towards my right side. This right here really gets that glute to fire and tighten up. You're able just to control how much pressure you're going to be putting from the racquetball into that muscle. Hold this one for about 15 seconds, relax and then repeat this one up to five times or until you feel that muscle knots start to release. If you feel like you need a little bit more of an intense one you can actually lift the leg up completely like this and allow the muscles to completely fire. This one right here is a little bit more advanced. So you just kind of lift it up straight up like this instead of trying to keep the heel on the floor like that. So give those ones a try. Those ones work really well for glute muscle spasms. So the foam roller method is also another good way to get rid of muscle knots over the lower portion of the lower back and into the glutes or buttock. Whatever side that I'm having a lot of muscle spasming or muscle tightness, what I want to do is take that side's leg and put it over the other just like this. Kind of like you're lounging almost. This creates what is known as a figure four stretch. It's really going to help stretch the glute, also the piriformis. And it's another note, if you are dealing with piriformis syndrome, I don't recommend this exercise because it can actually put more pressure into that muscle causing more irritation, possibly onto the sciatic nerve. So if you start to get any symptoms going down the leg that mimic piriformis syndrome, please discontinue this immediately. So getting back to this exercise, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just put my arms back just like this and I'm going to just put my weight onto that side's glued or buttock and then I'm just going to rock back and forth with the foam roller from the lower portion of the lower back all the way down to the butt bone. And what I'm going to do is just go over those muscle spots. Once I find the one that feels very tight I just simply rock on it very slowly for up to 15 seconds. Just take a little bit of a breather and then do that up to three to five times or until you feel that muscle knot start to relax and then you can just simply switch to the other side or just go over different spots as needed. So for this next part we're going to focus more on muscle knots and muscle spasms in the soft tissue around the hip joint. So let's start flat on our back with our knees bent just like this. Let's take our racket ball and place it over the hip where you're having a lot of muscle knots. What I'm going to do then is I'm going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest like this and then I'm going to then roll over the ball until my lower leg makes contact completely with the floor. Let's take the other leg and go completely flat with the foot like this to help stabilize us during this exercise. The bottom arm is going to be outreached just like this for more stabilization. So with this knee bent, what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm able to go. If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going to really feel this. So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds. This is the second part that's going to make it even more intense for those muscle spasms. While the leg is straight, just simply lift it up, I should say the leg up towards the ceiling as far as you're able to go. This should really put a lot of pressure into that muscle knot and hopefully give you a very good self-release or self-massage. Hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. You're then going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest into the starting position, take a little bit of a breather, and then just simply repeat this as many times as needed, usually up to about five times before you feel that muscle knot really start to relax. Then you can just reposition it over a new spot or switch to the other side. This is how we're going to fix muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a foam roller.

      "  Welcome to Ossir and Physio YouTube channel. Today we're going to be looking at the best exercises to deal with acute lower back pain. The first exercise for the acute lower back pain series are knees ways. This is a great exercise if you're finding that you're struggling to move and the back is spasming. What you want to do is lie on your back with a pillow underneath your neck, bringing the knees up and gently allowing the feet to rest on the floor. What we want to aim to do is gently let the knees sway side to side. This is aiming at increasing range of motion and mobility into the lower spine, softening through the postural muscles that have tightened up as well as allowing movement to be reintroduced into the lower spine. We want to aim to do this between one to two minutes. The next exercise are knee hugs. The aim of this exercise is to decompress through the lower spine. Due to the cuteness of the lower back we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the lower back, we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the leg back down. What this is starting to do is decompress and take a little bit of flexion into that lower spine as well as moving through the pelvis. We're aiming to repeat this about 10 to 15 times on each side. Again the range is determined by how it feels. If it's too much bringing the leg up just reduce the range of motion. The next exercise is looking at gentle side bending through the lower spine. The aim of this is to gently allow the body to move side to side. What this is doing is taking the joints and the discs into a side bending motion, while fixing the core nice and tight and stretching up through the body. We want to aim to do this gently each side for about a couple of minutes. If it is tender or painful as you're moving through, you want to continue the movement but you want to reduce the range. Finally we're looking at getting comfortable. This is demonstrating a really nice way to relax when resting with an acute spasm in the lower back. You want to aim to be in sideline position with a pillow between the knees, allowing the body to relax. Finally, walking is absolutely vital for a cute lower spine. This increases movement and allows blood to get into the area to help with recovery.\n",

      "  I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for Parkview Health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the bleed. Stop the bleed is very simple, three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a tourniquet. So let's start with pressure. If you come upon a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're gonna move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically we could use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze, or you could use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're gonna take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it anymore. And that's getting to the source of the bleeding. So we're going to just keep packing more and more and more. And it could be a deep wound, so don't be afraid. So once we've gotten this completely packed, hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding. So if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a tourniquet, just put the tourniquet on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super super tight. Then we're going to take the handle, we're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it and we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it, and we're going to write the time. For courses in our area, go to Parkview.com and search Stop the Bleed.\n",

      " e better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device it's pretty simple, you first twist this cap off, then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used, pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible so please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on it should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device. I know, I know it's time consuming but remember this, every time you use your lancet the needle becomes dull so one it's going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it adjusts just how deep the lancet tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video, you'll have to do it a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip three, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin. If you're still in pain when you're using this, then speak to your healthcare professional about getting thinner lancets. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring-loaded lancet that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the button so it releases the lancet to puncture your skin for the blood sample. So often I see patients blood glucose meters and their control solution has never even been opened. If you're not testing your machine or your test strips how can you be sure you're getting the right readings? Do you want me to do you next seat? Sure. So tip 4 was meant to be done by Lewis in the last scene, but you couldn't remember his part so I'll just have to do it. So perform a control solution test each time you open a new vial of test strips, or you feel like your meter isn't working properly. Let's say it's giving unexpected results, or you may have dropped it or damaged it. Now I've left more information in the description below about this. So, so, continuing on from our lancing device part, to test our blood glucose we need to get a few things ready. So we need a glucose monitor, it's specific test strips that are in date, a primed and ready to use lancing device which we did earlier, a cotton wool pad, a yellow sharpen and a monitoring diary so we can put our results in at the end. Next, remove a test strip from the vial and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point and warm up and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample. Now word of warning for the next thing, there will be a little bit of blood so if you don't like the sight of blood, skip forward maybe about 30 seconds. I'll put the information in the description too. Now let's do it. Place the Lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture site. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it, make sure your meter is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect a blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or update your electronic records. Tip 5, diabetic patients tend to build up a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're gonna use different machines you're gonna end up with slightly different results and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done. One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and lancets and put them in your yellow shark spin. The safest way to remove your lancet is by placing the lancet cap on a hard surface and pushing the lancet needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on with my guide by leaving a comment below because I'd love to read it. Thanks for watching. Hey guys thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe button now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. Tip 5. That's it. A yellow sharp end and our monitoring diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips, how can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?\n"

And then the second position is going to be turning their head rapidly to the opposite side on the count of three. One, two, three. And then 30 seconds later, go ahead and bend your right knee and then roll over onto your left side and you'll tilt their head down towards their left shoulder. And 30 seconds later, you'll have them sit up on the edge of the bed. And maintain their head tilted towards that left side. And 30 seconds later, they'll come up.\n",

      "  roll upon it. So my muscle knot right there on my left side is right about at the top of the glute or the buttock. Take the hand that's closest to the floor right here and just stabilize yourself at the elbow at 90 degrees. Put your arms out, your legs outstretched just like this. The bottom leg, what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring this one up towards the chest while the other one goes straight just like that. You're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to really target it. I'm going to take my hand on the opposite side. I'm going to grab below the knee and I'm going to bring that knee up like this. I'm rotating my left knee towards my right side. This right here really gets that glute to fire and tighten up. You're able just to control how much pressure you're going to be putting from the racquetball into that muscle. Hold this one for about 15 seconds, relax and then repeat this one up to five times or until you feel that muscle knots start to release. If you feel like you need a little bit more of an intense one you can actually lift the leg up completely like this and allow the muscles to completely fire. This one right here is a little bit more advanced. So you just kind of lift it up straight up like this instead of trying to keep the heel on the floor like that. So give those ones a try. Those ones work really well for glute muscle spasms. So the foam roller method is also another good way to get rid of muscle knots over the lower portion of the lower back and into the glutes or buttock. Whatever side that I'm having a lot of muscle spasming or muscle tightness, what I want to do is take that side's leg and put it over the other just like this. Kind of like you're lounging almost. This creates what is known as a figure four stretch. It's really going to help stretch the glute, also the piriformis. And it's another note, if you are dealing with piriformis syndrome, I don't recommend this exercise because it can actually put more pressure into that muscle causing more irritation, possibly onto the sciatic nerve. So if you start to get any symptoms going down the leg that mimic piriformis syndrome, please discontinue this immediately. So getting back to this exercise, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just put my arms back just like this and I'm going to just put my weight onto that side's glued or buttock and then I'm just going to rock back and forth with the foam roller from the lower portion of the lower back all the way down to the butt bone. And what I'm going to do is just go over those muscle spots. Once I find the one that feels very tight I just simply rock on it very slowly for up to 15 seconds. Just take a little bit of a breather and then do that up to three to five times or until you feel that muscle knot start to relax and then you can just simply switch to the other side or just go over different spots as needed. So for this next part we're going to focus more on muscle knots and muscle spasms in the soft tissue around the hip joint. So let's start flat on our back with our knees bent just like this. Let's take our racket ball and place it over the hip where you're having a lot of muscle knots. What I'm going to do then is I'm going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest like this and then I'm going to then roll over the ball until my lower leg makes contact completely with the floor. Let's take the other leg and go completely flat with the foot like this to help stabilize us during this exercise. The bottom arm is going to be outreached just like this for more stabilization. So with this knee bent, what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm able to go. If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going to really feel this. So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds. This is the second part that's going to make it even more intense for those muscle spasms. While the leg is straight, just simply lift it up, I should say the leg up towards the ceiling as far as you're able to go. This should really put a lot of pressure into that muscle knot and hopefully give you a very good self-release or self-massage. Hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. You're then going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest into the starting position, take a little bit of a breather, and then just simply repeat this as many times as needed, usually up to about five times before you feel that muscle knot really start to relax. Then you can just reposition it over a new spot or switch to the other side. This is how we're going to fix muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a foam roller. Go to the side that you are looking to target those muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a f\n"

      "  Welcome to Ossir and Physio YouTube channel. Today we're going to be looking at the best exercises to deal with acute lower back pain. The first exercise for the acute lower back pain series are knees ways. This is a great exercise if you're finding that you're struggling to move and the back is spasming. What you want to do is lie on your back with a pillow underneath your neck, bringing the knees up and gently allowing the feet to rest on the floor. What we want to aim to do is gently let the knees sway side to side. This is aiming at increasing range of motion and mobility into the lower spine, softening through the postural muscles that have tightened up as well as allowing movement to be reintroduced into the lower spine. We want to aim to do this between one to two minutes. The next exercise are knee hugs. The aim of this exercise is to decompress through the lower spine. Due to the cuteness of the lower back we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the lower back, we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the leg back down. What this is starting to do is decompress and take a little bit of flexion into that lower spine as well as moving through the pelvis. We're aiming to repeat this about 10 to 15 times on each side. Again the range is determined by how it feels. If it's too much bringing the leg up just reduce the range of motion. The next exercise is looking at gentle side bending through the lower spine. The aim of this is to gently allow the body to move side to side. What this is doing is taking the joints and the discs into a side bending motion, while fixing the core nice and tight and stretching up through the body. We want to aim to do this gently each side for about a couple of minutes. If it is tender or painful as you're moving through, you want to continue the movement but you want to reduce the range. Finally we're looking at getting comfortable. This is demonstrating a really nice way to relax when resting with an acute spasm in the lower back. You want to aim to be in sideline position with a pillow between the knees, allowing the body to relax. Finally, walking is absolutely vital for a cute lower spine. This increases movement and allows blood to get into the area to help with recovery.\n",

      "  I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for Parkview Health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the bleed. Stop the bleed is very simple, three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a tourniquet. So let's start with pressure. If you come upon a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're gonna move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically we could use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze, or you could use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're gonna take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it anymore. And that's getting to the source of the bleeding. So we're going to just keep packing more and more and more. And it could be a deep wound, so don't be afraid. So once we've gotten this completely packed, hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding. So if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a tourniquet, just put the tourniquet on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super super tight. Then we're going to take the handle, we're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it and we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it, and we're going to write the time. For courses in our area, go to Parkview.com and search Stop the Bleed.\n",

      " e better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device it's pretty simple, you first twist this cap off, then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used, pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible so please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on it should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device. I know, I know it's time consuming but remember this, every time you use your lancet the needle becomes dull so one it's going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it adjusts just how deep the lancet tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video, you'll have to do it a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip three, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin. If you're still in pain when you're using this, then speak to your healthcare professional about getting thinner lancets. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring-loaded lancet that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the button so it releases the lancet to puncture your skin for the blood sample. So often I see patients blood glucose meters and their control solution has never even been opened. If you're not testing your machine or your test strips how can you be sure you're getting the right readings? Do you want me to do you next seat? Sure. So tip 4 was meant to be done by Lewis in the last scene, but you couldn't remember his part so I'll just have to do it. So perform a control solution test each time you open a new vial of test strips, or you feel like your meter isn't working properly. Let's say it's giving unexpected results, or you may have dropped it or damaged it. Now I've left more information in the description below about this. So, so, continuing on from our lancing device part, to test our blood glucose we need to get a few things ready. So we need a glucose monitor, it's specific test strips that are in date, a primed and ready to use lancing device which we did earlier, a cotton wool pad, a yellow sharpen and a monitoring diary so we can put our results in at the end. Next, remove a test strip from the vial and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point and warm up and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample. Now word of warning for the next thing, there will be a little bit of blood so if you don't like the sight of blood, skip forward maybe about 30 seconds. I'll put the information in the description too. Now let's do it. Place the Lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture site. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it, make sure your meter is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect a blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or update your electronic records. Tip 5, diabetic patients tend to build up a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're gonna use different machines you're gonna end up with slightly different results and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done. One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and lancets and put them in your yellow shark spin. The safest way to remove your lancet is by placing the lancet cap on a hard surface and pushing the lancet needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on with my guide by leaving a comment below because I'd love to read it. Thanks for watching. Hey guys thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe button now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. Tip 5. That's it. A yellow sharp end and our monitoring diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips, how can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?\n",

You're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to really target it. I'm going to take my hand on the opposite side. I'm going to grab below the knee and I'm going to bring that knee up like this. I'm rotating my left knee towards my right side. This right here really gets that glute to fire and tighten up. You're able just to control how much pressure you're going to be putting from the racquetball into that muscle. Hold this one for about 15 seconds, relax and then repeat this one up to five times or until you feel that muscle knots start to release. If you feel like you need a little bit more of an intense one you can actually lift the leg up completely like this and allow the muscles to completely fire. This one right here is a little bit more advanced. So you just kind of lift it up straight up like this instead of trying to keep the heel on the floor like that. So give those ones a try. Those ones work really well for glute muscle spasms. So the foam roller method is also another good way to get rid of muscle knots over the lower portion of the lower back and into the glutes or buttock. Whatever side that I'm having a lot of muscle spasming or muscle tightness, what I want to do is take that side's leg and put it over the other just like this. Kind of like you're lounging almost. This creates what is known as a figure four stretch. It's really going to help stretch the glute, also the piriformis. And it's another note, if you are dealing with piriformis syndrome, I don't recommend this exercise because it can actually put more pressure into that muscle causing more irritation, possibly onto the sciatic nerve. So if you start to get any symptoms going down the leg that mimic piriformis syndrome, please discontinue this immediately. So getting back to this exercise, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just put my arms back just like this and I'm going to just put my weight onto that side's glued or buttock and then I'm just going to rock back and forth with the foam roller from the lower portion of the lower back all the way down to the butt bone. And what I'm going to do is just go over those muscle spots. Once I find the one that feels very tight I just simply rock on it very slowly for up to 15 seconds. Just take a little bit of a breather and then do that up to three to five times or until you feel that muscle knot start to relax and then you can just simply switch to the other side or just go over different spots as needed. So for this next part we're going to focus more on muscle knots and muscle spasms in the soft tissue around the hip joint. So let's start flat on our back with our knees bent just like this. Let's take our racket ball and place it over the hip where you're having a lot of muscle knots. What I'm going to do then is I'm going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest like this and then I'm going to then roll over the ball until my lower leg makes contact completely with the floor. Let's take the other leg and go completely flat with the foot like this to help stabilize us during this exercise. The bottom arm is going to be outreached just like this for more stabilization. So with this knee bent, what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm able to go. If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going to really feel this. So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds. This is the second part that's going to make it even more intense for those muscle spasms. While the leg is straight, just simply lift it up, I should say the leg up towards the ceiling as far as you're able to go. This should really put a lot of pressure into that muscle knot and hopefully give you a very good self-release or self-massage. Hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. You're then going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest into the starting position, take a little bit of a breather, and then just simply repeat this as many times as needed, usually up to about five times before you feel that muscle knot really start to relax. Then you can just reposition it over a new spot or switch to the other side. This is how we're going to fix muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a foam roller. Go to the side that you are looking to target those muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a f\n",

      "  Welcome to Ossir and Physio YouTube channel. Today we're going to be looking at the best exercises to deal with acute lower back pain. The first exercise for the acute lower back pain series are knees ways. This is a great exercise if you're finding that you're struggling to move and the back is spasming. What you want to do is lie on your back with a pillow underneath your neck, bringing the knees up and gently allowing the feet to rest on the floor. What we want to aim to do is gently let the knees sway side to side. This is aiming at increasing range of motion and mobility into the lower spine, softening through the postural muscles that have tightened up as well as allowing movement to be reintroduced into the lower spine. We want to aim to do this between one to two minutes. The next exercise are knee hugs. The aim of this exercise is to decompress through the lower spine. Due to the cuteness of the lower back we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the lower back, we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the leg back down. What this is starting to do is decompress and take a little bit of flexion into that lower spine as well as moving through the pelvis. We're aiming to repeat this about 10 to 15 times on each side. Again the range is determined by how it feels. If it's too much bringing the leg up just reduce the range of motion. The next exercise is looking at gentle side bending through the lower spine. The aim of this is to gently allow the body to move side to side. What this is doing is taking the joints and the discs into a side bending motion, while fixing the core nice and tight and stretching up through the body. We want to aim to do this gently each side for about a couple of minutes. If it is tender or painful as you're moving through, you want to continue the movement but you want to reduce the range. Finally we're looking at getting comfortable. This is demonstrating a really nice way to relax when resting with an acute spasm in the lower back. You want to aim to be in sideline position with a pillow between the knees, allowing the body to relax. Finally, walking is absolutely vital for a cute lower spine. This increases movement and allows blood to get into the area to help with recovery.\n",

      "  I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for Parkview Health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the bleed. Stop the bleed is very simple, three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a tourniquet. So let's start with pressure. If you come upon a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're gonna move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically we could use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze, or you could use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're gonna take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it anymore. And that's getting to the source of the bleeding. So we're going to just keep packing more and more and more. And it could be a deep wound, so don't be afraid. So once we've gotten this completely packed, hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding. So if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a tourniquet, just put the tourniquet on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super super tight. Then we're going to take the handle, we're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it and we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it, and we're going to write the time. For courses in our area, go to Parkview.com and search Stop the Bleed.\n",

      " e better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device it's pretty simple, you first twist this cap off, then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used, pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible so please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on it should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device. I know, I know it's time consuming but remember this, every time you use your lancet the needle becomes dull so one it's going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it adjusts just how deep the lancet tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video, you'll have to do it a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip three, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin. If you're still in pain when you're using this, then speak to your healthcare professional about getting thinner lancets. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring-loaded lancet that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the button so it releases the lancet to puncture your skin for the blood sample. So often I see patients blood glucose meters and their control solution has never even been opened. If you're not testing your machine or your test strips how can you be sure you're getting the right readings? Do you want me to do you next seat? Sure. So tip 4 was meant to be done by Lewis in the last scene, but you couldn't remember his part so I'll just have to do it. So perform a control solution test each time you open a new vial of test strips, or you feel like your meter isn't working properly. Let's say it's giving unexpected results, or you may have dropped it or damaged it. Now I've left more information in the description below about this. So, so, continuing on from our lancing device part, to test our blood glucose we need to get a few things ready. So we need a glucose monitor, it's specific test strips that are in date, a primed and ready to use lancing device which we did earlier, a cotton wool pad, a yellow sharpen and a monitoring diary so we can put our results in at the end. Next, remove a test strip from the vial and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point and warm up and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample. Now word of warning for the next thing, there will be a little bit of blood so if you don't like the sight of blood, skip forward maybe about 30 seconds. I'll put the information in the description too. Now let's do it. Place the Lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture site. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it, make sure your meter is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect a blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or update your electronic records. Tip 5, diabetic patients tend to build up a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're gonna use different machines you're gonna end up with slightly different results and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done. One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and lancets and put them in your yellow shark spin. The safest way to remove your lancet is by placing the lancet cap on a hard surface and pushing the lancet needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on with my guide by leaving a comment below because I'd love to read it. Thanks for watching. Hey guys thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe button now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. Tip 5. That's it. A yellow sharp end and our monitoring diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips, how can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?\n"

So now we're going to move into the Epley maneuver to actually treat the symptoms. So what you're going to do is you're going to take the patient and you're going to turn their head 45 degrees towards the side that was triggered, 20 degrees extension, you'll have them hold your arm again. And the difference between the Dick's Hall Pike and and the Epley maneuver is a couple things. We're actually going to bring them down much more quickly to help jar those crystals loose out of the canal. The other important piece of information is we want to be able to maintain that position for at least 30 seconds or until the symptoms start to dissipate. So on the count of three we're going to bring you down really quick. One, two, three. Now with this mistake that therapists make is they will actually maintain the position for 30 seconds but the patient will still have symptoms. You want to make sure that you stay in this position at least 30 seconds but if after 30 seconds they still have spinning, you want to maintain that position until that starts to go away. And then the second position is going to be turning their head rapidly to the opposite side on the count of three. One, two, three. And then 30 seconds later, go ahead and bend your right knee and then roll over onto your left side and you'll tilt their head down towards their left shoulder. And 30 seconds later, you'll have them sit up on the edge of the bed. And maintain their head tilted towards that left side. And 30 seconds later, they'll come up.\n",

      "  roll upon it. So my muscle knot right there on my left side is right about at the top of the glute or the buttock. Take the hand that's closest to the floor right here and just stabilize yourself at the elbow at 90 degrees. Put your arms out, your legs outstretched just like this. The bottom leg, what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring this one up towards the chest while the other one goes straight just like that. You're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to really target it. I'm going to take my hand on the opposite side. I'm going to grab below the knee and I'm going to bring that knee up like this. I'm rotating my left knee towards my right side. This right here really gets that glute to fire and tighten up. You're able just to control how much pressure you're going to be putting from the racquetball into that muscle. Hold this one for about 15 seconds, relax and then repeat this one up to five times or until you feel that muscle knots start to release. If you feel like you need a little bit more of an intense one you can actually lift the leg up completely like this and allow the muscles to completely fire. This one right here is a little bit more advanced. So you just kind of lift it up straight up like this instead of trying to keep the heel on the floor like that. So give those ones a try. Those ones work really well for glute muscle spasms. So the foam roller method is also another good way to get rid of muscle knots over the lower portion of the lower back and into the glutes or buttock. Whatever side that I'm having a lot of muscle spasming or muscle tightness, what I want to do is take that side's leg and put it over the other just like this. Kind of like you're lounging almost. This creates what is known as a figure four stretch. It's really going to help stretch the glute, also the piriformis. And it's another note, if you are dealing with piriformis syndrome, I don't recommend this exercise because it can actually put more pressure into that muscle causing more irritation, possibly onto the sciatic nerve. So if you start to get any symptoms going down the leg that mimic piriformis syndrome, please discontinue this immediately. So getting back to this exercise, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just put my arms back just like this and I'm going to just put my weight onto that side's glued or buttock and then I'm just going to rock back and forth with the foam roller from the lower portion of the lower back all the way down to the butt bone. And what I'm going to do is just go over those muscle spots. Once I find the one that feels very tight I just simply rock on it very slowly for up to 15 seconds. Just take a little bit of a breather and then do that up to three to five times or until you feel that muscle knot start to relax and then you can just simply switch to the other side or just go over different spots as needed. So for this next part we're going to focus more on muscle knots and muscle spasms in the soft tissue around the hip joint. So let's start flat on our back with our knees bent just like this. Let's take our racket ball and place it over the hip where you're having a lot of muscle knots. What I'm going to do then is I'm going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest like this and then I'm going to then roll over the ball until my lower leg makes contact completely with the floor. Let's take the other leg and go completely flat with the foot like this to help stabilize us during this exercise. The bottom arm is going to be outreached just like this for more stabilization. So with this knee bent, what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm able to go. If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going to really feel this. So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds. This is the second part that's going to make it even more intense for those muscle spasms. While the leg is straight, just simply lift it up, I should say the leg up towards the ceiling as far as you're able to go. This should really put a lot of pressure into that muscle knot and hopefully give you a very good self-release or self-massage. Hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. You're then going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest into the starting position, take a little bit of a breather, and then just simply repeat this as many times as needed, usually up to about five times before you feel that muscle knot really start to relax. Then you can just reposition it over a new spot or switch to the other side. This is how we're going to fix muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a foam roller. Go to the side that you are looking to target those muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a f\n"

Let's take the other leg and go completely flat with the foot like this to help stabilize us during this exercise. The bottom arm is going to be outreached just like this for more stabilization. So with this knee bent, what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm able to go. If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going to really feel this. So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds. This is the second part that's going to make it even more intense for those muscle spasms. While the leg is straight, just simply lift it up, I should say the leg up towards the ceiling as far as you're able to go. This should really put a lot of pressure into that muscle knot and hopefully give you a very good self-release or self-massage. Hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. You're then going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest into the starting position, take a little bit of a breather, and then just simply repeat this as many times as needed, usually up to about five times before you feel that muscle knot really start to relax.\n",

      "  Welcome to Ossir and Physio YouTube channel. Today we're going to be looking at the best exercises to deal with acute lower back pain. The first exercise for the acute lower back pain series are knees ways. This is a great exercise if you're finding that you're struggling to move and the back is spasming. What you want to do is lie on your back with a pillow underneath your neck, bringing the knees up and gently allowing the feet to rest on the floor. What we want to aim to do is gently let the knees sway side to side. This is aiming at increasing range of motion and mobility into the lower spine, softening through the postural muscles that have tightened up as well as allowing movement to be reintroduced into the lower spine. We want to aim to do this between one to two minutes. The next exercise are knee hugs. The aim of this exercise is to decompress through the lower spine. Due to the cuteness of the lower back we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the lower back, we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the leg back down. What this is starting to do is decompress and take a little bit of flexion into that lower spine as well as moving through the pelvis. We're aiming to repeat this about 10 to 15 times on each side. Again the range is determined by how it feels. If it's too much bringing the leg up just reduce the range of motion. The next exercise is looking at gentle side bending through the lower spine. The aim of this is to gently allow the body to move side to side. What this is doing is taking the joints and the discs into a side bending motion, while fixing the core nice and tight and stretching up through the body. We want to aim to do this gently each side for about a couple of minutes. If it is tender or painful as you're moving through, you want to continue the movement but you want to reduce the range. Finally we're looking at getting comfortable. This is demonstrating a really nice way to relax when resting with an acute spasm in the lower back. You want to aim to be in sideline position with a pillow between the knees, allowing the body to relax. Finally, walking is absolutely vital for a cute lower spine. This increases movement and allows blood to get into the area to help with recovery.\n",

      "  I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for Parkview Health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the bleed. Stop the bleed is very simple, three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a tourniquet. So let's start with pressure. If you come upon a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're gonna move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically we could use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze, or you could use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're gonna take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it anymore. And that's getting to the source of the bleeding. So we're going to just keep packing more and more and more. And it could be a deep wound, so don't be afraid. So once we've gotten this completely packed, hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding. So if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a tourniquet, just put the tourniquet on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super super tight. Then we're going to take the handle, we're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it and we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it, and we're going to write the time. For courses in our area, go to Parkview.com and search Stop the Bleed.\n",

      " e better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device it's pretty simple, you first twist this cap off, then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used, pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible so please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on it should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device. I know, I know it's time consuming but remember this, every time you use your lancet the needle becomes dull so one it's going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it adjusts just how deep the lancet tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video, you'll have to do it a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip three, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin. If you're still in pain when you're using this, then speak to your healthcare professional about getting thinner lancets. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring-loaded lancet that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the button so it releases the lancet to puncture your skin for the blood sample. So often I see patients blood glucose meters and their control solution has never even been opened. If you're not testing your machine or your test strips how can you be sure you're getting the right readings? Do you want me to do you next seat? Sure. So tip 4 was meant to be done by Lewis in the last scene, but you couldn't remember his part so I'll just have to do it. So perform a control solution test each time you open a new vial of test strips, or you feel like your meter isn't working properly. Let's say it's giving unexpected results, or you may have dropped it or damaged it. Now I've left more information in the description below about this. So, so, continuing on from our lancing device part, to test our blood glucose we need to get a few things ready. So we need a glucose monitor, it's specific test strips that are in date, a primed and ready to use lancing device which we did earlier, a cotton wool pad, a yellow sharpen and a monitoring diary so we can put our results in at the end. Next, remove a test strip from the vial and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point and warm up and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample. Now word of warning for the next thing, there will be a little bit of blood so if you don't like the sight of blood, skip forward maybe about 30 seconds. I'll put the information in the description too. Now let's do it. Place the Lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture site. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it, make sure your meter is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect a blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or update your electronic records. Tip 5, diabetic patients tend to build up a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're gonna use different machines you're gonna end up with slightly different results and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done. One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and lancets and put them in your yellow shark spin. The safest way to remove your lancet is by placing the lancet cap on a hard surface and pushing the lancet needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on with my guide by leaving a comment below because I'd love to read it. Thanks for watching. Hey guys thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe button now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. Tip 5. That's it. A yellow sharp end and our monitoring diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips, how can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?\n",

      "  So we've done the Dick's Hall Pike maneuver and let's assume that we triggered symptoms when we had the patient positioned to the right. So now we're going to move into the Epley maneuver to actually treat the symptoms. So what you're going to do is you're going to take the patient and you're going to turn their head 45 degrees towards the side that was triggered, 20 degrees extension, you'll have them hold your arm again. And the difference between the Dick's Hall Pike and and the Epley maneuver is a couple things. We're actually going to bring them down much more quickly to help jar those crystals loose out of the canal. The other important piece of information is we want to be able to maintain that position for at least 30 seconds or until the symptoms start to dissipate. So on the count of three we're going to bring you down really quick. One, two, three. Now with this mistake that therapists make is they will actually maintain the position for 30 seconds but the patient will still have symptoms. You want to make sure that you stay in this position at least 30 seconds but if after 30 seconds they still have spinning, you want to maintain that position until that starts to go away. And then the second position is going to be turning their head rapidly to the opposite side on the count of three. One, two, three. And then 30 seconds later, go ahead and bend your right knee and then roll over onto your left side and you'll tilt their head down towards their left shoulder. And 30 seconds later, you'll have them sit up on the edge of the bed. And maintain their head tilted towards that left side. And 30 seconds later, they'll come up.\n"

Take the hand that's closest to the floor right here and just stabilize yourself at the elbow at 90 degrees. Put your arms out, your legs outstretched just like this. The bottom leg, what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring this one up towards the chest while the other one goes straight just like that. You're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to really target it. I'm going to take my hand on the opposite side. I'm going to grab below the knee and I'm going to bring that knee up like this. I'm rotating my left knee towards my right side. This right here really gets that glute to fire and tighten up. You're able just to control how much pressure you're going to be putting from the racquetball into that muscle. Hold this one for about 15 seconds, relax and then repeat this one up to five times or until you feel that muscle knots start to release. If you feel like you need a little bit more of an intense one you can actually lift the leg up completely like this and allow the muscles to completely fire. This one right here is a little bit more advanced. So you just kind of lift it up straight up like this instead of trying to keep the heel on the floor like that. So give those ones a try. Those ones work really well for glute muscle spasms. So the foam roller method is also another good way to get rid of muscle knots over the lower portion of the lower back and into the glutes or buttock. Whatever side that I'm having a lot of muscle spasming or muscle tightness, what I want to do is take that side's leg and put it over the other just like this. Kind of like you're lounging almost. This creates what is known as a figure four stretch. It's really going to help stretch the glute, also the piriformis. And it's another note, if you are dealing with piriformis syndrome, I don't recommend this exercise because it can actually put more pressure into that muscle causing more irritation, possibly onto the sciatic nerve. So if you start to get any symptoms going down the leg that mimic piriformis syndrome, please discontinue this immediately. So getting back to this exercise, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just put my arms back just like this and I'm going to just put my weight onto that side's glued or buttock and then I'm just going to rock back and forth with the foam roller from the lower portion of the lower back all the way down to the butt bone. And what I'm going to do is just go over those muscle spots. Once I find the one that feels very tight I just simply rock on it very slowly for up to 15 seconds. Just take a little bit of a breather and then do that up to three to five times or until you feel that muscle knot start to relax and then you can just simply switch to the other side or just go over different spots as needed. So for this next part we're going to focus more on muscle knots and muscle spasms in the soft tissue around the hip joint. So let's start flat on our back with our knees bent just like this. Let's take our racket ball and place it over the hip where you're having a lot of muscle knots. What I'm going to do then is I'm going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest like this and then I'm going to then roll over the ball until my lower leg makes contact completely with the floor. Let's take the other leg and go completely flat with the foot like this to help stabilize us during this exercise. The bottom arm is going to be outreached just like this for more stabilization. So with this knee bent, what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm able to go. If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going to really feel this. So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds. This is the second part that's going to make it even more intense for those muscle spasms. While the leg is straight, just simply lift it up, I should say the leg up towards the ceiling as far as you're able to go. This should really put a lot of pressure into that muscle knot and hopefully give you a very good self-release or self-massage. Hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. You're then going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest into the starting position, take a little bit of a breather, and then just simply repeat this as many times as needed, usually up to about five times before you feel that muscle knot really start to relax. Then you can just reposition it over a new spot or switch to the other side. This is how we're going to fix muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a foam roller.

You want to aim to be in sideline position with a pillow between the knees, allowing the body to relax. Finally, walking is absolutely vital for a cute lower spine. This increases movement and allows blood to get into the area to help with recovery.\n",

      "  I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for Parkview Health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the bleed. Stop the bleed is very simple, three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a tourniquet. So let's start with pressure. If you come upon a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're gonna move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically we could use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze, or you could use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're gonna take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it anymore. And that's getting to the source of the bleeding. So we're going to just keep packing more and more and more. And it could be a deep wound, so don't be afraid. So once we've gotten this completely packed, hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding. So if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a tourniquet, just put the tourniquet on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super super tight. Then we're going to take the handle, we're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it and we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it, and we're going to write the time.

      " e better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device it's pretty simple, you first twist this cap off, then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used, pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible so please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on it should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device. I know, I know it's time consuming but remember this, every time you use your lancet the needle becomes dull so one it's going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it adjusts just how deep the lancet tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video, you'll have to do it a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip three, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin. If you're still in pain when you're using this, then speak to your healthcare professional about getting thinner lancets. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring-loaded lancet that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the button so it releases the lancet to puncture your skin for the blood sample. So often I see patients blood glucose meters and their control solution has never even been opened. If you're not testing your machine or your test strips how can you be sure you're getting the right readings? Do you want me to do you next seat? Sure. So tip 4 was meant to be done by Lewis in the last scene, but you couldn't remember his part so I'll just have to do it. So perform a control solution test each time you open a new vial of test strips, or you feel like your meter isn't working properly. Let's say it's giving unexpected results, or you may have dropped it or damaged it. Now I've left more information in the description below about this. So, so, continuing on from our lancing device part, to test our blood glucose we need to get a few things ready. So we need a glucose monitor, it's specific test strips that are in date, a primed and ready to use lancing device which we did earlier, a cotton wool pad, a yellow sharpen and a monitoring diary so we can put our results in at the end. Next, remove a test strip from the vial and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point and warm up and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample. Now word of warning for the next thing, there will be a little bit of blood so if you don't like the sight of blood, skip forward maybe about 30 seconds. I'll put the information in the description too. Now let's do it. Place the Lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture site. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it, make sure your meter is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect a blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or update your electronic records. Tip 5, diabetic patients tend to build up a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're gonna use different machines you're gonna end up with slightly different results and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done. One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and lancets and put them in your yellow shark spin. The safest way to remove your lancet is by placing the lancet cap on a hard surface and pushing the lancet needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on with my guide by leaving a comment below because I'd love to read it. Thanks for watching. Hey guys thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe button now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. Tip 5. That's it. A yellow sharp end and our monitoring diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips, how can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?\n"

      "  So we've done the Dick's Hall Pike maneuver and let's assume that we triggered symptoms when we had the patient positioned to the right. So now we're going to move into the Epley maneuver to actually treat the symptoms. So what you're going to do is you're going to take the patient and you're going to turn their head 45 degrees towards the side that was triggered, 20 degrees extension, you'll have them hold your arm again. And the difference between the Dick's Hall Pike and and the Epley maneuver is a couple things. We're actually going to bring them down much more quickly to help jar those crystals loose out of the canal. The other important piece of information is we want to be able to maintain that position for at least 30 seconds or until the symptoms start to dissipate. So on the count of three we're going to bring you down really quick. One, two, three. Now with this mistake that therapists make is they will actually maintain the position for 30 seconds but the patient will still have symptoms. You want to make sure that you stay in this position at least 30 seconds but if after 30 seconds they still have spinning, you want to maintain that position until that starts to go away. And then the second position is going to be turning their head rapidly to the opposite side on the count of three. One, two, three. And then 30 seconds later, go ahead and bend your right knee and then roll over onto your left side and you'll tilt their head down towards their left shoulder. And 30 seconds later, you'll have them sit up on the edge of the bed. And maintain their head tilted towards that left side. And 30 seconds later, they'll come up.\n",

      "  roll upon it. So my muscle knot right there on my left side is right about at the top of the glute or the buttock. Take the hand that's closest to the floor right here and just stabilize yourself at the elbow at 90 degrees. Put your arms out, your legs outstretched just like this. The bottom leg, what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring this one up towards the chest while the other one goes straight just like that. You're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to really target it. I'm going to take my hand on the opposite side. I'm going to grab below the knee and I'm going to bring that knee up like this. I'm rotating my left knee towards my right side. This right here really gets that glute to fire and tighten up. You're able just to control how much pressure you're going to be putting from the racquetball into that muscle. Hold this one for about 15 seconds, relax and then repeat this one up to five times or until you feel that muscle knots start to release. If you feel like you need a little bit more of an intense one you can actually lift the leg up completely like this and allow the muscles to completely fire. This one right here is a little bit more advanced. So you just kind of lift it up straight up like this instead of trying to keep the heel on the floor like that. So give those ones a try. Those ones work really well for glute muscle spasms. So the foam roller method is also another good way to get rid of muscle knots over the lower portion of the lower back and into the glutes or buttock. Whatever side that I'm having a lot of muscle spasming or muscle tightness, what I want to do is take that side's leg and put it over the other just like this. Kind of like you're lounging almost. This creates what is known as a figure four stretch. It's really going to help stretch the glute, also the piriformis. And it's another note, if you are dealing with piriformis syndrome, I don't recommend this exercise because it can actually put more pressure into that muscle causing more irritation, possibly onto the sciatic nerve. So if you start to get any symptoms going down the leg that mimic piriformis syndrome, please discontinue this immediately. So getting back to this exercise, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just put my arms back just like this and I'm going to just put my weight onto that side's glued or buttock and then I'm just going to rock back and forth with the foam roller from the lower portion of the lower back all the way down to the butt bone. And what I'm going to do is just go over those muscle spots. Once I find the one that feels very tight I just simply rock on it very slowly for up to 15 seconds. Just take a little bit of a breather and then do that up to three to five times or until you feel that muscle knot start to relax and then you can just simply switch to the other side or just go over different spots as needed. So for this next part we're going to focus more on muscle knots and muscle spasms in the soft tissue around the hip joint. So let's start flat on our back with our knees bent just like this. Let's take our racket ball and place it over the hip where you're having a lot of muscle knots. What I'm going to do then is I'm going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest like this and then I'm going to then roll over the ball until my lower leg makes contact completely with the floor. Let's take the other leg and go completely flat with the foot like this to help stabilize us during this exercise. The bottom arm is going to be outreached just like this for more stabilization. So with this knee bent, what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm able to go. If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going to really feel this. So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds. This is the second part that's going to make it even more intense for those muscle spasms. While the leg is straight, just simply lift it up, I should say the leg up towards the ceiling as far as you're able to go. This should really put a lot of pressure into that muscle knot and hopefully give you a very good self-release or self-massage. Hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. You're then going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest into the starting position, take a little bit of a breather, and then just simply repeat this as many times as needed, usually up to about five times before you feel that muscle knot really start to relax. Then you can just reposition it over a new spot or switch to the other side. This is how we're going to fix muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a foam roller. Go to the side that you are looking to target those muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a f\n"

      "  Welcome to Ossir and Physio YouTube channel. Today we're going to be looking at the best exercises to deal with acute lower back pain. The first exercise for the acute lower back pain series are knees ways. This is a great exercise if you're finding that you're struggling to move and the back is spasming. What you want to do is lie on your back with a pillow underneath your neck, bringing the knees up and gently allowing the feet to rest on the floor. What we want to aim to do is gently let the knees sway side to side. This is aiming at increasing range of motion and mobility into the lower spine, softening through the postural muscles that have tightened up as well as allowing movement to be reintroduced into the lower spine. We want to aim to do this between one to two minutes. The next exercise are knee hugs. The aim of this exercise is to decompress through the lower spine. Due to the cuteness of the lower back we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the lower back, we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the leg back down. What this is starting to do is decompress and take a little bit of flexion into that lower spine as well as moving through the pelvis. We're aiming to repeat this about 10 to 15 times on each side. Again the range is determined by how it feels. If it's too much bringing the leg up just reduce the range of motion. The next exercise is looking at gentle side bending through the lower spine. The aim of this is to gently allow the body to move side to side. What this is doing is taking the joints and the discs into a side bending motion, while fixing the core nice and tight and stretching up through the body. We want to aim to do this gently each side for about a couple of minutes. If it is tender or painful as you're moving through, you want to continue the movement but you want to reduce the range. Finally we're looking at getting comfortable. This is demonstrating a really nice way to relax when resting with an acute spasm in the lower back. You want to aim to be in sideline position with a pillow between the knees, allowing the body to relax. Finally, walking is absolutely vital for a cute lower spine. This increases movement and allows blood to get into the area to help with recovery.\n",

The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a tourniquet. So let's start with pressure. If you come upon a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're gonna move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically we could use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze, or you could use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're gonna take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it anymore. And that's getting to the source of the bleeding. So we're going to just keep packing more and more and more. And it could be a deep wound, so don't be afraid. So once we've gotten this completely packed, hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding. So if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a tourniquet, just put the tourniquet on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super super tight. Then we're going to take the handle, we're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle.

To load a lancing device it's pretty simple, you first twist this cap off, then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used, pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible so please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on it should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device. I know, I know it's time consuming but remember this, every time you use your lancet the needle becomes dull so one it's going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it adjusts just how deep the lancet tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video, you'll have to do it a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip three, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin. If you're still in pain when you're using this, then speak to your healthcare professional about getting thinner lancets. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring-loaded lancet that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the button so it releases the lancet to puncture your skin for the blood sample. So often I see patients blood glucose meters and their control solution has never even been opened. If you're not testing your machine or your test strips how can you be sure you're getting the right readings? Do you want me to do you next seat? Sure. So tip 4 was meant to be done by Lewis in the last scene, but you couldn't remember his part so I'll just have to do it. So perform a control solution test each time you open a new vial of test strips, or you feel like your meter isn't working properly. Let's say it's giving unexpected results, or you may have dropped it or damaged it. Now I've left more information in the description below about this. So, so, continuing on from our lancing device part, to test our blood glucose we need to get a few things ready. So we need a glucose monitor, it's specific test strips that are in date, a primed and ready to use lancing device which we did earlier, a cotton wool pad, a yellow sharpen and a monitoring diary so we can put our results in at the end. Next, remove a test strip from the vial and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point and warm up and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample. Now word of warning for the next thing, there will be a little bit of blood so if you don't like the sight of blood, skip forward maybe about 30 seconds. I'll put the information in the description too. Now let's do it. Place the Lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture site. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it, make sure your meter is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect a blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or update your electronic records. Tip 5, diabetic patients tend to build up a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're gonna use different machines you're gonna end up with slightly different results and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done. One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and lancets and put them in your yellow shark spin. The safest way to remove your lancet is by placing the lancet cap on a hard surface and pushing the lancet needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on with my guide by leaving a comment below because I'd love to read it. Thanks for watching. Hey guys thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe button now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. Tip 5. That's it. A yellow sharp end and our monitoring diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips, how can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?\n",

      "  So we've done the Dick's Hall Pike maneuver and let's assume that we triggered symptoms when we had the patient positioned to the right. So now we're going to move into the Epley maneuver to actually treat the symptoms. So what you're going to do is you're going to take the patient and you're going to turn their head 45 degrees towards the side that was triggered, 20 degrees extension, you'll have them hold your arm again. And the difference between the Dick's Hall Pike and and the Epley maneuver is a couple things. We're actually going to bring them down much more quickly to help jar those crystals loose out of the canal. The other important piece of information is we want to be able to maintain that position for at least 30 seconds or until the symptoms start to dissipate. So on the count of three we're going to bring you down really quick. One, two, three. Now with this mistake that therapists make is they will actually maintain the position for 30 seconds but the patient will still have symptoms. You want to make sure that you stay in this position at least 30 seconds but if after 30 seconds they still have spinning, you want to maintain that position until that starts to go away. And then the second position is going to be turning their head rapidly to the opposite side on the count of three. One, two, three. And then 30 seconds later, go ahead and bend your right knee and then roll over onto your left side and you'll tilt their head down towards their left shoulder. And 30 seconds later, you'll have them sit up on the edge of the bed. And maintain their head tilted towards that left side. And 30 seconds later, they'll come up.\n"
