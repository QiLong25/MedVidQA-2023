      " in this video I'm going to show you how.to reset forward rounded shoulders with.a move that you probably haven't seen.before.stay tuned.hey everyone dr Rowe here at spine care.in st Joseph Michigan in today's world.rounded forward shoulders are becoming a.very big problem think just using cell.phones driving you name it our posture.is always leaning forward that puts a.lot of strain into the shoulder capsule.and draws it forward or anterior so what.we're going to focus on is a really easy.way to bring those shoulders back reduce.a lot of muscle tension in there and.hopefully reset those shoulders and give.you a lot of pain relief the great part.is this does not require any special.equipment can be done pretty much.anywhere at home at work you name it so.let's get started with it so before we.begin I want to note that this is not.intended for anybody that has shoulder.instability or has had complete shoulder.replacement surgeries or any surgery for.that matter if you have rotator cuff.issues major issues into the shoulder.this is not designed for it so don't.even ask if you have to ask my answer is.always going to be instead to go talk to.your local doctor to get a.recommendation so how we're going to.reset a forward rounded shoulder is with.a push-pull exercise you need two things.the first being a hand washing towel.that is going to act as a cushion and.the next is a doorframe so I hope you.have a doorframe what we're going to do.is take the side that we're looking to.reset or self adjust and put the cushion.or that washcloth right here right up.against the door and we're going to put.our elbow directly into it you want to.position the arm and shoulder to the.point where the tricep or the bottom of.the arm is parallel with the floor the.hand should kind of just rest right over.the shoulder when you do this just feel.like you're kind of reaching backwards.with your fingers so I'm going to then.take the opposite side leg in this case.would be my right and I'm going to bend.it because what we're going to do is.lunge into this to get a pushing.sensation into the shoulder to draw it.backwards so this is the first part I'm.going to take my right hand I'm going to.place on the opposite side of the.doorframe and I'm going to.all into my body wait I should say into.the doorframe.you should start to feel the shoulder.start to go posterior or backwards and.get a good stretch into the shoulder.only go to your comfort level once you.hit that this is going to be the next.part take your body weight and then.lunge into it very very slowly to.intensify the stretch and I'm telling.you right now this feels really good.into the shoulder I hold it to my.comfort level for fifteen to thirty.seconds I'm going to then relax and then.do three to five repetitions with this.one you might feel a pop or a crack.sensation or self release into the.shoulder capsule because if that.shoulder is locked and drawn forward.with that posterior movement it's going.to free it and kind of reset that ball.in socket joint whatever you do don't.try to use your body weight to really.like lunge into it and force that.release you can actually cause more.irritation so if it pops or cracks.through the natural motion of the.shoulder that's completely normal.don't try to force it so with this next.part we're going to focus on two big.instigators of rounded shoulders that is.tight chest or PEC muscles and also the.rhomboids so what we're going to do is.hit them both at the same time with this.stretch it's literally one of my.favorite stretches I do it all the time.throughout the day you go back to the.doorframe you're going to take your.hands or I should say your arms and.you're going to again put your triceps.at about parallel with the floor place.them directly against the doorframe just.like this put your feet together and.then you're just going to use your body.weight to lean into the doorframe the.goal with this it should feel like a.very good stretch in the front with.those PEC muscles but also you should.feel a stretch in the mid-back region.those are the rhomboids where the.muscles that connect the spine to the.shoulder blades really getting a good.stretch in there it should almost feel.like the shoulder blades are trying to.pinch so once I go to a stretch that.feels very good to my comfort level I.hold that up to fifteen to thirty.seconds I.relax and do three to five repetitions.and hopefully this does a lot for those.shoulders helps them bring them back get.you a lot of relief give it a try so if.you liked the video and got a lot of.relief please show us your support by.giving this video like and maybe.subscribing to our channel too if you.have any comments or questions please.leave them below and I'll get back to.you as soon as I can thank you for.watching\n",

      " in this video I'm going to show you how.to reset forward rounded shoulders with.a move that you probably haven't seen.before.stay tuned.hey everyone dr Rowe here at spine care.in st Joseph Michigan in today's world.rounded forward shoulders are becoming a.very big problem think just using cell.phones driving you name it our posture.is always leaning forward that puts a.lot of strain into the shoulder capsule.and draws it forward or anterior so what.we're going to focus on is a really easy.way to bring those shoulders back reduce.a lot of muscle tension in there and.hopefully reset those shoulders and give.you a lot of pain relief the great part.is this does not require any special.equipment can be done pretty much.anywhere at home at work you name it so.let's get started with it so before we.begin I want to note that this is not.intended for anybody that has shoulder.instability or has had complete shoulder.replacement surgeries or any surgery for.that matter if you have rotator cuff.issues major issues into the shoulder.this is not designed for it so don't.even ask if you have to ask my answer is.always going to be instead to go talk to.your local doctor to get a.recommendation so how we're going to.reset a forward rounded shoulder is with.a push-pull exercise you need two things.the first being a hand washing towel.that is going to act as a cushion and.the next is a doorframe so I hope you.have a doorframe what we're going to do.is take the side that we're looking to.reset or self adjust and put the cushion.or that washcloth right here right up.against the door and we're going to put.our elbow directly into it you want to.position the arm and shoulder to the.point where the tricep or the bottom of.the arm is parallel with the floor the.hand should kind of just rest right over.the shoulder when you do this just feel.like you're kind of reaching backwards.with your fingers so I'm going to then.take the opposite side leg in this case.would be my right and I'm going to bend.it because what we're going to do is.lunge into this to get a pushing.sensation into the shoulder to draw it.backwards so this is the first part I'm.going to take my right hand I'm going to.place on the opposite side of the.doorframe and I'm going to.all into my body wait I should say into.the doorframe.you should start to feel the shoulder.start to go posterior or backwards and.get a good stretch into the shoulder.only go to your comfort level once you.hit that this is going to be the next.part take your body weight and then.lunge into it very very slowly to.intensify the stretch and I'm telling.you right now this feels really good.into the shoulder I hold it to my.comfort level for fifteen to thirty.seconds I'm going to then relax and then.do three to five repetitions with this.one you might feel a pop or a crack.sensation or self release into the.shoulder capsule because if that.shoulder is locked and drawn forward.with that posterior movement it's going.to free it and kind of reset that ball.in socket joint whatever you do don't.try to use your body weight to really.like lunge into it and force that.release you can actually cause more.irritation so if it pops or cracks.through the natural motion of the.shoulder that's completely normal.don't try to force it so with this next.part we're going to focus on two big.instigators of rounded shoulders that is.tight chest or PEC muscles and also the.rhomboids so what we're going to do is.hit them both at the same time with this.stretch it's literally one of my.favorite stretches I do it all the time.throughout the day you go back to the.doorframe you're going to take your.hands or I should say your arms and.you're going to again put your triceps.at about parallel with the floor place.them directly against the doorframe just.like this put your feet together and.then you're just going to use your body.weight to lean into the doorframe the.goal with this it should feel like a.very good stretch in the front with.those PEC muscles but also you should.feel a stretch in the mid-back region.those are the rhomboids where the.muscles that connect the spine to the.shoulder blades really getting a good.stretch in there it should almost feel.like the shoulder blades are trying to.pinch so once I go to a stretch that.feels very good to my comfort level I.hold that up to fifteen to thirty.seconds I.relax and do three to five repetitions.and hopefully this does a lot for those.shoulders helps them bring them back get.you a lot of relief give it a try so if.you liked the video and got a lot of.relief please show us your support by.giving this video like and maybe.subscribing to our channel too if you.have any comments or questions please.leave them below and I'll get back to.you as soon as I can thank you for.watching\n",

this.stretch is part of my office stretching series where I go from head to toe.stretching out the whole body, and it's real time stretches so I know a lot of.you like that if you want to check out some more make sure you click on the.link up there so with the standing quad stretch, you can pretty much do this.anywhere you don't have to hold on to anything, but I always say it's best to.hold on because then you can focus on your stretches just a little bit more so.with the quad stretch you really want to get in a good position I'm gonna go.ahead and have my timer getting ready to go, and I'll just explain as we go along,.but it's gonna be 30 seconds stretches three on each side and we're gonna take.a little 10-second rest break in between so I'm gonna go ahead and start it and.then we'll go along so with the quad stretch standing, you're just gonna grab.your foot and make sure the top part of your leg is straight down so the.important part of that stretch is that that quad is down if it's here, you're.not really gonna get a good stretch so you want it there and maybe even back.just a little bit the closer you can get your heel to the bottom your bottom, the.better stretch you're gonna get but you know I have to pull it all the way back.just pull it until you feel a little stretch in there and then take that.little break in between but again if your, if your thigh is coming forward,.then you're no longer stretching your quad, so you really want to focus on that.so if you have to hold on a lot to be able to do that, that's fine.also the most important thing second to getting that that leg back there is not.to lean forward because see you can be like well my legs back now, but if you're.leaning forward, again you're taking away from that stretch, so keep your upper.body nice and upright and just pull backwards again you don't have to pull.up as high as I do I stretch every day, so I'm pretty flexible so if you can.only go to there that's okay, you just go until you feel a comfortable stretch.with that you can also add in a little bit more pushing back to get the hip.flexors as well if you want so if I'm stretching here and I pulled.that knee back just a little bit more, I'm going to get those hip flexors.stretching a little bit as well so if you really want to get kind of a.combination stretch, you can do that because that's a great area to stretch.out if you're sitting, no falling, if you're sitting a lot throughout the day.because those muscles are in a shortened position so if you pull it back just a.little bit, you're gonna get a combination stretch which is really good.as well there's a whole bunch of different ways to stretch out your quad,.you can do it lying down, you can do it lying on your side, on your stomach, you.can use a strap to stretch it out, but if you're at work and you don't really have.equipment, this is the best way to stretch it out, and it's pretty easy to.do especially if you work at a desk and you don't get to move a lot because you.can just stand up at your desk you don't have to go anywhere to stretch out and.so this is a good way just to keep those muscles moving especially if you don't.get to move your legs throughout the day because you don't want to get blood.clots or DVT or anything like that stretching out your legs is a great way.to prevent all of that so again just moving out stretching it out a little.bit, getting that break in too, and then we've.got one more on each side so with the quad stretch, you should feel it right.through here some people feel it a little bit more in their knee, that could.be because maybe that joint is tight as well so if you're feeling it more in.your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again maybe you can't go as.high but try and bring that leg back just a little bit and that will should.help get that muscle versus that knee joint because it's all connected and.since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is.going to be very tight as well, so if you feel like your knee is hurting and.you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go.ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching and.there might be something else going on, and you should check in.with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just.tight muscles, there might actually something going on in there,.and you really want to find out what's going on so it shouldn't be painful you.should just feel tension with the stretch out your stretching through it.so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is.a part of my office stretching series, real time stretches from head to toe, so.if you want to check out some more of those, make sure you click on the link up.here and if you would like to support my channel.find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by.clicking down here and

Open your eyes'.Still no response? You can pinch their ear lobe to see if they respond to pain.Depending on how the casualty responds to you will stablish a level of response.We use the AVPU scale and each letter can represent the casualty level of response.A ?Alert, V- response to voice, P ?response to pain and U ?is the casualty unresponsive to any stimuli.If there still no response they are unresponsive and we need to check their airway.If the casualty is alert and speaking to you, you know that there is no problem with the airway It is clear.If the casualty is unresponsive, open their airway by putting one hand on the forehead.and gently tilting the head back with two fingers under the chin.Now we need to check to see if they are breathing normally.We do this by placing our ear and cheek over their nose and mouth,.looking down the body to see if their chest rises and falls.We do this for 10 seconds.If the casualty is not breathing normally call for help.Ask them to call 999/112 for emergency help and bring an AED.If you are alone, call for emergency help using a mobile on speaker phone.and begin CPR with chest compressions.The casualty is breathing normally, so I going to check their circulation.Are there any signs of severe bleeding? Look and check down the body.If you find severe bleeding, try to control the bleeding to prevent life-threatening shock.Call 999/112 for emergency help before continuing to treat the casualty.You may also need to treat them for shock.Ie established that my casualty is not bleeding.So remember  to do a primary survey: Follow the order DR ABC.Complete each step, in that order, as quickly as possible,.dealing with any life-threatening conditions as you find them.Call for emergency help ?call 999/112.And that how we perform a primary survey.If this video has been helpful to you, help support St John Ambulance by.going to sjaorguk/donate\n",

      " Hi, my name is Lisa and I a physical therapist here at The Nebraska Medical Center I.here today to show you some basic tips for how to use crutches correctly If you have.not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to.be fit properly for you So I going to go through a couple of basics for that.The first thing you can check on your crutches to see if there a tool that will help.you decide your height and where they should be This is kind of a reference only So you.want to get the hole set to where your height is as a general reference point And then.youe going to turn the crutches right-side up and when you stand nice and tall with the.crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at side, the wrist part should line up.about with your wrist so that your pad and your wrist are even And if you put your hands.on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it The other thing to remember is that you.should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that.there some space there The first thing you want to remember if youe using crutches.is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads, because you can cause nerve damage.that will affect the sensation and the strength in your arms so that when you put your hands.on the crutches, you do have a slight bend in your elbow and a slight gap underneath.your armpits of about two finger-widths.Youe going to put your affected extremity or leg forward, both crutches will be on the.side of the injured leg Youe going to push up from the hand grip with one hand and.the chair or the bed with the opposite hand Youe going to lean forward, push up with.both arms Once you have your balance, youl bring one crutch around to the opposite side.and place both crutches beneath your armpits And you can see that I am using the surface.behind me (the chair) a little bit, just to get some balance when I transferring one.crutch from one side to the other.When you go from a standing position to a seated position, whether that be a chair or.a bed behind you, you want to back all the way up to the surface with your crutches until.you feel the chair or the bed behind your unaffected leg Then youe going to bring.the crutch around from your unaffected side to your injured side, bring the crutches out.from underneath your armpits, reach down for the hand grips With the opposite hands, youe.going to reach down for the chair or the bed If you have a chair rest, it will be easier.to reach for that You kick the affected foot forward and you have a seat Nice and controlled.What you don want to do is just look back to see if it there, bring your crutches.forward and have a seat like this.Once your crutches are fit correctly and youe standing up, youe going to bring one crutch.around to the other side and stand up tall Your doctor will let you know how much weight.you can put through your leg For this video, I demonstrating not putting any weight.through my injured leg Youe going to bring your crutches forward first, swing the.affected or injured leg forward first, and then take a small step with your good leg.Crutches forward Step As you get better, you can start to take longer steps.To ascend and descend stairs, take steps until youe as close to the staircase as you.can be If you have a railing, you want to use the railing if it available The first.thing youe going to do is take one of the crutches out from the side that youe.using the railing on Place both crutches underneath the opposite side, reach for the.hand railing, and you step up with your good leg So youe going to put weight through.both hands, step up with your left foot And then you bring your crutches up And my injured.leg is hanging behind me Youe going to push through your hands and step up again.Once youe at the top of the staircase, bring one crutch around again and continue.walking.To descend the stairs, youe going to bring your crutches around to the opposite side.as the railing that youe using and take a hold of the hand rail with the other hand.To go down, you go down with your crutches first, then your injured leg comes forward.and you put the weight through your hands to step with your left foot, one step at a.time Always remember to follow your doctor orders, as far as how much weight you can.put through your injured leg But a few key things to remember when using crutches will.help you heal and get home safely: remember not to lean your arm pits onto the top of.the crutches, remember to always stand tall, and youe going to move your crutches forward.before you step with your uninjured side\n",

When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer or if we're driving, we kind of hold up our shoulders like this and that that muscle is connected to that shoulder scalp really gets tight sometimes it can cause headaches sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck back area and cause some stiffness so it's really good to stretch out and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, you're going to kind of sit on the hand. And if that's uncomfortable to sit on it, you can just take your fists and kind of push downwards. But again, holding that for 30 seconds, doing that three times, probably on each side if you've got just levator scapulae stretch and that's t\", \"levator scapulae stretch and that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck.

So the side that you want to stretch if I'm stretching my left side I'm going to take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscle is connected to that shoulder blade You want to hold it down to get the best stretch So if this is painful you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're going to get the stretch. You don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're going to get the stretch. Then you want to stretch if I'm stretching my left side I'm going to take my left hand and just kind of put it on the b\", \"and you can do that couple times a day. So I'll do the other side, holding this one up with my elbow, hand behind my head, pulling down towards the opposite side. So again, really holding it for 30 seconds, doing that three times, probably on each side if you've got just some general neck stiffness, and you can do that a couple times a day. So I'll do the other side, holding this one up with my elbow, hand behind my head, pulling down towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there. And it should be a good kind of hurt so good feeling, but it shouldn't be painful at all.\"]\n",

So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in a neutral position. So you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're actually tucking it in that way. Just do your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds just doing about five times couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movements. So once you get the chin tuck down, then what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine, if you hold the towel with this hand and up and across with this hand.

This one you don't hucking in like this and you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking in that, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you have lots of little chins right there, and you want to hold it for about three to five seconds just doing about five times couple times a day. The next one I really like is using a towel to help stretch your neck and get that stiffness and tightness out. This is called snags it's a particular technique. It stands for something really long But what I like to do is use the towel because a lot of times the towel can help hold the segments So like if I'm holding here and turning then I'm getting that extra stretch in there to get th\", \"chin tuck, and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it.

You can just do it a smooth continuous motion. But if you wanna hold the motion or the movement for a little bit, you can get that stretch a little bit higher. Then you're gonna grab the towel with your opposite hand here and you're gonna stabilize that towel right there or hold it in one spot. So that holds the vertebrae there so you can get the stretch a little bit higher. Then you're gonna grab the other hand making sure you're not choking yourself but bring it up and over your ear. So this time you're going to kind of pull up and over. Sometimes it's hard to get down.

So I'm pulling down with this hand and up and across with this hand. So I'm getting a nice good stretch in there.

So the next one is going to just be a levator scapulae stretch and that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck. And those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer or if we're driving, we kind of hold up our shoulders like this and that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck. And those are the ones that hold a lot of tightness. That is connected to that shoulder blade You want to hold it down to get the best stretch So if this is painful you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're going to get the stretch. Then you want to stretch if I'm stretching my left side I'm going to take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up.

So the side that you want to stretch if I'm stretching my left side I'm going to take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up.

What that do\", \"and you can do that a couple times a day. So I'll do the other side, holding this one up with my elbow, hand behind my head, pulling down towards the opposite side. So again, really holding it for 30 seconds, doing that three times, probably on each side if you've got just some general neck stiffness, and you can do that a couple times a day. So I'll do the other side, holding this one up with my elbow, hand behind my head, pulling down towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there. And it should be a good kind of hurt so good feeling, but it shouldn't be painful at all.\"]\n",

So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage and we're going to apply first a tourniquet and slowly move that tourniquet towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go, we continue wrapping the extremity, we stretch and apply, stretch and apply, stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. And as we start assessing the distal peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodilation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators. The inflammatory mediators then vasodilate the peripheral veins. So here we can clearly see a very nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for cannulation something that previously we could not see. Now here's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bend that catheter, bend that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very peripheral veins even in the most difficult patients.

What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. You want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right, and I'm going to bend it because what we're going to do is lunge into this to get a pushing sensation into the shoulder to draw it backwards. So this is the first part. Take your body weight and then lunge into it very, very slowly to intensify the stretch. I'm telling you right now, this feels really good into the shoulder. I hold it to my comfort level for 15 to 30 seconds. I'm going to then relax and then do three to five repetitions. With this one, you might feel a pop or a crack sensation or self-release into the shoulder capsule because if that shoulder is locked and drawn forward with that posterior movement, it's going to free it and reset that ball and socket joint. Whatever you do, don't try to use your body weight to really lunge into it and force that release. You can actually cause more irritation. So if it pops or cracks through the natural motion of the shoulder that's completely normal. Don't try to force it. So with this next part we're going to focus on two big instigators of rounded shoulders that is tight chest or pec muscles and also the rhomboids. So what we're going to do is hit them both at the same time with this stretch. It's literally one of my favorite stretches. I do it all the time throughout the day. You go back to the door frame.

The goal with this is you should feel like a very good stretch in the front with those packed muscles, but also you should feel a stretch in the mid-back region.

Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair, but just lift your heels up off the ground and then slowly come back down.

So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out of there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here, and then you're going to do a chin tuck, and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move but what I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into. So I'm doing like that to get that segment stabilized and then I'm tucking in my chin and going back into extension. So you can see it's that combination moves. Sometimes it's hard to get down. This one you don't have to hold as long. You can just do it a smooth continuous motion. But if you wanna hold the motion or the movement for a little bit, you can hold that three to five. But sometimes this one, since it's a little bit more complicated, it's either easier just to do kind of that smooth motion without holding. So I'm going, pushing down now, going into that chin tuck, looking up, coming back in, and then releasing. So again, if I wanted to hold it, I'd do that chin tuck, look back, hold it for about three to five seconds, come back in, and relax. If any of these are painful, don't do it. When you're mobilizing things, you really need to make sure that you don't have something where you shouldn't be mobilizing that spine. So if it hurts in any way, hold off and check in with your doctor or your physical therapist. So the next one that you can do is same kind of motion with the chin tucks, except now you're just gonna do some turns with it. So this time it's not necessarily the up and over like the snags, but you're just going to do that same kind of motion where you're tucking in the chin. Now this time I'm stabilizing with this side and then I'm just going to help do the stretch and over while I'm doing that chin tuck. So I'm going to stabilize here, go into the chin tuck, and then just get that turn. And I don't know if you heard that at all, but for that I got a little little pop, a little adjustment in my neck. And as long as it's not painful, that's fine. So again, this one's just a little bit more continuous movement to get that mobilization in there. So I'm gonna do the other way so you can see it. So now I'm kind of stabilizing with this side. I'm tucking in my chin and then I'm using that towel just to help get that little bit of a turn. Little pause, come back in and relax and reset myself. So again you have to work a little bit at this to get the movement.

And those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer or if we're driving, we kind of hold up our shoulders like this and that gets a lot of tightness in there and then that muscle right there that levator scalp really gets tight sometimes it can cause headaches sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck back area and cause some stiffness so it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch if I'm stretching my left side I'm going to take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscle is connected to that shoulder blade You want to hold it down to get the best stretch So if this is painful you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're going to get that mobilization in there.

Sometimes it's hard to do all those combinations but if you can get it right you're really going to get that stiffness out of there. So it works really really well. So the next one is going to just be levator scapulae stretch and that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck. And those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer or if we're driving, we kind of hold up our shoulders like this and that gets a lot of tightness in there and then that muscle right there that levator scalp really gets tight sometimes it can cause headaches sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck back area and cause some stiffness so it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch if I'm stretching my left side I'm going to take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscle is connected to that shoulder blade You want to hold it down to get the best stretch So if this is painful you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're going to get that mobilization in there. So I'm gonna do the other way so you can see it. So now I'm kind of stabilizing with this side. I'm tucking in my chin and then I'm using that towel just to help get that little bit of a turn. Little pause, come back in and relax and reset myself. So again you have to work a little bit at this to get the movement. Sometimes\", \"then releasing. So again, if I wanted to hold it, I'd do that chin tuck, look back, hold it for about three to five seconds, come back in, and relax. If any of these are painful, don't do it. When you're mobilizing things, you really need to make sure that you don't have something where you shouldn't be mobilizing that spine. So if it hurts in any way, hold off and check in with your doctor or your physical therapist. So the next one that you can do is same kind of motion with the chin tucks, except now you're just gonna do some turns with it. So this time it's not necessarily the up and over like the snags, but you're just going to do that same kind of motion where you're tucking in the chin. Now this time I'm stabilizing with this side and then I'm just going to help do the stretch and over while I'm doing that chin tuck. So I'm going to stabilize here, go into the chin tuck, and then just get that turn. And I don't know if you heard that at all, but for that I got a little little pop, a little adjustment in my neck. And as long as it's not painful, that's fine. So again, this one's just a little bit more continuous movement to get that mobilization in there. So I'm gonna do the other way so you can see it. So now I'm kind of stabilizing with this side. I'm tucking in my chin and then I'm using that towel just to help get that little bit of a turn. Little pause, come back in and relax and reset myself.

So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee.

And since it's so big up there, when it's tight, your neck can be really, really stiff. So this time what you want to do is the side that you want to stretch, you're going to kind of sit on the hand. And if that's uncomfortable to sit on it, you can just take your fists and kind of push downwards. But again, this is to hold that shoulder down to get the best stretch. You don't have to do this part, but it's really going to get a better stretch because then when you go into the stretch, your shoulder is not going to come up. So this time you really are just going, pulling almost your ear towards the shoulder. So you're really just going to go to the side. Your hand is going to come up and over and then just gently pull over to the side to get that stretch. So this time you should kind of feel it through here.

      "StampText:  ite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. Chin tucks are easy to do. You can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in a neutral position. So you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you have lots of little chins right there, and you want to hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you want to use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds, and then when you relax you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there so I really really like that and again hold it three to five seconds just do\n"

So the next one is going to just be a levator scapulae stretch and that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck. And those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer or if we're driving, we kind of hold up our shoulders like this and that gets a lot of tightness in there and then that muscle right there that levator scalp really gets tight sometimes it can cause headaches sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck back area and cause some stiffness so it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch if I'm stretching my left side I'm going to take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscle is connected to that shoulder blade You want to hold it down to get the best stretch So if this is painful you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're going to get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand and place it kind of behind your head, and you're going to pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there. And it should be a good kind of hurt so good feeling, but it shouldn't be painful at all. So again, holding that for 30 seconds, doing that three times, probably on each side if you've got just some general neck stiffness, and you can do that a couple times a day. So I'll do the other side, holding this one up with my elbow, hand behind my head, pulling down towards the opposite side. So again, really holding it for 30 seconds, get that good stretch in there. I like to alternate back and forth. You don't have to. You can do them all on one side, all on the other side, but I feel like when you alternate ba\", \"me.

So again, really holding it for 30 seconds, get that good stretch in there. I like to alternate back and forth. You don't have to. You can do them all on one side, all on the other side, but I feel like when you alternate back and forth you give the muscle a little time to relax and reset. And then the last one is going to be an upper trap stretch, which is the big muscle over all of those. And that's another one that holds a lot of stress and tightness. And since it's so big up there, when it's tight, your neck can be really, really stiff. So this time what you want to do is the side that you want to stretch, you're going to kind of sit on the hand. And if that's uncomfortable to sit on it, you can just take your fists and kind of push downwards. But again, this is to hold that shoulder down to get the best stretch. You don't have to do this part, but it's really going to get a better stretch because then when you go into the stretch, your shoulder is not going to come up. So this time you really are just going, pulling almost your ear towards the shoulder. So you're really just going to go to the side. Your hand is going to come up and over and then just gently pull over to the side to get that stretch. So this time you should kind of feel it through here. Some people still do feel it in the back a little bit, but usually it's right through here. Still holding that stretch for 30 seconds, doing that three times, probably on each side\"]\n",

Now this time I'm stabilizing with this side and then I'm just going to help do the stretch and over while I'm doing that chin tuck. So I'm going to stabilize here, go into the chin tuck, and then just get that turn. And I don't know if you heard that at all, but for that I got a little little pop, a little adjustment in my neck. And as long as it's not painful, that's fine. So again, this one's just a little bit more continuous movement to get that mobilization in there.\", \"So now I'm kind of stabilizing with this side. I'm tucking in my chin and then I'm using that towel just to help get that little bit of a turn. Little pause, come back in and relax and reset myself. So again you have to work a little bit at this to get the movement. Sometimes it's hard to do all those combinations but if you can get it right you're really going to get that stiffness out of there. So it works really really well. So the next one is going to just be a levator scapulae stretch and that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck. And those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer or if we're driving, we kind of hold up our shoulders like this and that gets a lot of tightness in there and then that muscle right there that levator scalp really gets tight sometimes it can cause headaches sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck back area and cause some stiffness so it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch if I'm stretching my left side I'm going to take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscle is connected to that shoulder blade You want to hold it down to get the best stretch So if this is painful you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're going to get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand and place it kind of behind your head, and you're going to pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there. And it should be a good kind of hurt so good feeling, but it shouldn't be painful at all. So again, holding that for 30 seconds, doing that three times, probably on each side if you've got just some general neck stiffness, and you can do that a couple times a day. So I'll do the other side, holding this one up with my elbow, hand behind my head, pulling down towards the opposite side. So again, really holding it for 30 seconds, get that good stretch in there. I like to alternate back and forth. You don't have to. You can do them all on one side, all on the other side, but I feel like when you alter\", \"So now I'm kind of stabilizing with this side. I'm tucking in my chin and then I'm using that towel just to help get that little bit of a turn. Little pause, come back in and relax and reset myself.

      "StampText:  So with this one the snag What you're gonna do is you're gonna grab the towel with your opposite hand here and you're gonna stabilize that towel right there or hold it in one spot. So that holds the vertebrae there so you can get the stretch a little bit higher. Then you're gonna grab the other hand making sure you're not choking yourself but bring it up and over your ear. So this time you're gonna kind of pull up and over so you. So this time you're going to kind of pull up and over. So you're not just pulling across, that's that's going into choking yourself a little bit, but up and over. But if you hold the towel kind of right over your ear, you get a good pull. So I'm pulling down with this hand and up and across with this hand. So I'm getting a nice good stretch in there. And so this one, since it's a full stretch, I'm going to hold it for 30 seconds. And then after that 30 seconds, if you want to switch sides, you can. So now I'm holding it with this one right over here, and then grabbing this one and coming up and over. So again, ki\n"

I like to alternate back and forth. You don't have to. You can do them all on one side, but it's hard to do all.

So the next one is going to just be a levator scapulae stretch and that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck. And those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer or if we're driving, we kind of hold up our shoulders like this and that gets a lot of tightness in there and then that muscle right there that levator scalp really gets tight sometimes it can cause headaches sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck back area and cause some stiffness so it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch if I'm stretching my left side I'm going to take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscle is connected to that shoulder blade You want to hold it down to get the best stretch So if this is painful you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're going to get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand and place it kind of behind your head, and you're going to pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there. And it should be a good kind of hurt so good feeling, but it shouldn't be painful at all.

      "StampText:   if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in a neutral position. So you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you have lots of little chins right there, and you want to hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you want to use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds, and then when you relax you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there so I really really like that and again hold it three to five seconds just doing about five times couple tim\n",

If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're gonna move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically we could use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze, or you could use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're gonna take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it anymore. And that's getting to the source of the bleeding. So we're going to just keep packing more and more and more. And it could be a deep wound, so don't be afraid. So once we've gotten this completely packed, hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding. So if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a tourniquet, just put the tourniquet on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super super tight.

So here we have a patient in the operating room 8 and it comes with a 10-15 minute delay. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least. And then we applied it first round with the S-mark bandage, which is for the tourniquet purposes. And then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay so here's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bend that catheter, bend that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very peripheral veins.

So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage and we're going to apply first a tourniquet and slowly move that tourniquet towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go, we continue wrapping the extremity, we stretch and apply, stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. And as we start assessing the distal peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodilation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators. The inflammatory mediators then vasodilate the peripheral veins. So here we can clearly see a very nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for cannulation something that previously we could not see. Now here's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bend that catheter, bend that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very peripheral veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay so here's another example again another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and IV line that went on unsuccessfully. So we're going to then proceed to the placement on the other side here where you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated because that would drain the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally.

      "StampText:  thods. Most patients coming to the operating room have already fasted, they dehydrated their frightened scare, they have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be cold and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses and things like that but that really takes time. Now no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access but the truth is the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins it's great for deeper veins and also by the way you would not make too many surgeons happy by wheeling in another cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now.

      "AnsText:  [\"that you probably haven't seen before. Stay tuned. Hey, everyone. Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world, rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Just using cell phones, driving, you name it, our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is this does not require any special equipment can be done pretty much Anywhere at home at work you name it. So let's get started with it So before we begin I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability Or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to do is lunge into this to get a pushing sensation into the shoulder to draw it backwards. So this is the first part. Take your body weight and then lunge into it very, very slowly to intensify the stretch. I'm telling you right now, this feels really good into the shoulder. I hold it to my comfort level for 15 to 30 seconds. I'm going to then relax and then do three to five repetitions. With this one, you might feel a pop or a crack sensation or self-release into the shoulder capsule because if that shoulder is locked and drawn forward with that posterior movement, it's going to free it and reset that ball and socket joint. Whatever you do, don't try to use your body weight to really lunge into it and force that release. You can actually cause more irritation. So if it pops or cracks through the natural motion of the shoulder that's completely normal. Don't try to force it. So with this next part we're going to focus on two big instigators of rounded shoulders that is tight chest or pec muscles and also the rhomboids. So what we're going to do is hit them both at the same time with this stretch. It's literally one of my favorite stretches. I do it all the time throughout the day. You go back to the door frame. You're going to take your hands, or I should say your arms, and you're going to again put your triceps at about parallel with the floor. Place them directly against the door frame just like this. Put your feet together and then you're just going to use your body weight to lean into the door frame. The goal with this is you should feel like a very good stretch in the front with those packed muscles, but also you should feel a stretch in the mid-back region. Those are the rhomboids, or the muscles that connect the spine to the shoulder blades, really getting a good stretch in there. It should almost feel like the shoulder blades are trying to pinch. So once I go to a stretch that feels very good to my comfort level, I hold that up to 15 to 30 seconds. Again, relax and do three to five repetitions. And hopefully this does a lot for those shoulders. Helps them bring them back, gets you a lot of relief. Give it a try. So if you liked the video and got a lot of relief, please show us your support by giving this video a like and maybe subscribing to our channel too.

You want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right, and I'm going to bend it because what we're going to do is lunge into this to get a pushing sensation into the shoulder to draw it backwards. So this is the first part. I'm going to take my right hand, I'm going to place on the opposite side of the door frame, and I'm going to pull into my body weight, I should say, into the door frame. You should start to feel the shoulder, start to go posterior or backwards, and get a good stretch into the shoulder. Only go to your comfort level.

      "AnsText:  [\"Chin tucks are easy to do. You can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in a neutral position. So you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you have lots of little chins right there, and you want to hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you want to use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds, and then when you relax you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there so I really really like that and again hold it three to five seconds just doing about five times couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then movements. So once you get the chin tuck down, then what the towel does is again, kind of up where your ear is, not on your neck, but up and over, and then pulling down with this one and up and over with that one. Again, holding that stretch for 30 seconds and then doing it three on each side. If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can \"]\n",
      "StampText:   like to do is use the towel because a lot of times the towel can help hold the segments So like if I'm holding here and turning then I'm getting that extra stretch in there to get that tightness out So with this one the snag What you're gonna do is you're gonna grab the towel with your opposite hand here and you're gonna stabilize that towel right there or hold it in one spot. So that holds the vertebrae there so you can get the stretch a little bit higher. Then you're gonna grab the other hand making sure you're not choking yourself but bring it up and over your ear. So this time you're gonna kind of pull up and over so you. So this time you're going to kind of pull up and over. So you're not just pulling across, that's that's going into choking yourself a little bit, but up and over. But if you hold the towel kind of right over your ear, you get a good pull. So I'm pulling down with this hand and up and across with this hand. So I'm getting a nice good stretch in there. And so this one, since it's a full stretch, I'm going to hold it for 30 seconds. And then after that 30 seconds, if you want to switch sides, you can. So now I'm holding it with this one right over here, and then grabbing this one and coming up and over. So again, kind of up where your ear is, not on your neck, but up and over, and then pulling down with this one, and up and over and then pulling down with this one and up and over with that one.

So I'm doing like that to get that segment stabilized and then I'm tucking in my chin and going back into extension. So you can see it's that combination moves. Sometimes it's hard to get down. This one you don't have to hold as long. You can just do it a smooth continuous motion. But if you wanna hold the motion or the movement for a little bit, you can hold that three to five. But sometimes this one, since it's a little bit more complicated, it's either easier just to do kind of that smooth motion without holding. So I'm going, pushing down now, going into that chin tuck, looking up, coming back in, and then releasing. So again, kind of up where your ear is, not on your neck, but it's really good to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch if I'm stretching my left side I'm going to take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscle is connected to that shoulder blade You want to hold it down to get the best stretch So if this is painful you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're going to get the same way of motion where you're tucking in the chin. Now this time I'm stabilizing with this side and then I'm just going to help do the stretch and over while I'm doing that chin tuck. So I'll do the other side, holding this one up with my elbow, hand behind my head, pulling down towards the opposite side.

Sometimes it's hard to do all those combinations but if you can get it right you're really going to get that stiffness out of there. So it works really really well. So the next one is going to just be a levator scapulae stretch and that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck. And those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer or if we're driving, we kind of hold up our shoulders like this and that gets a lot of tightness in there and then that muscle right there that levator scalp really gets tight sometimes it can cause headaches sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck back area and cause some stiffness so it's really good to stretch out and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch if I'm stretching my left side I'm going to take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscle is connected to that shoulder blade You want to hold it down to get the best stretch So if this is painful you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're going to get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand and place it kind of behind your head, and you're going to pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going strai\n"

      "AnsText:  [\"But what I like to do is use the towel because a lot of times the towel can help hold the segments So like if I'm holding here and turning then I'm getting that extra stretch in there to get that tightness out So with this one the snag What you're gonna do is you're gonna grab the towel with your opposite hand here and you're gonna stabilize that towel right there or hold it in one spot. So that holds the vertebrae there so you can get the stretch a little bit higher. Then you're gonna grab the other hand making sure you're not choking yourself but bring it up and over your chins right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you have lots of little chins right there, and you want to hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you want to use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds, and then when you relax you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there so I really really like that and again hold it three to five seconds just doing about five times couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then movements. So once you get the chin tuck down, then what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine, if you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out of there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here, and then you're going to do a chin tuck, and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move but what I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into. So I'm kind of stabilizing with this side. I'm tucking in my chin and then I'm just going to help do the stretch and over while I'm doing that chin tuck. So I'll do the other side, holding this one up with my elbow, hand behind my head, pulling down towards the opposite side. So again, really holding it for 30 seconds, stretch for 30 seconds and then doing it three on each side. If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also\"]\n",
      "StampText:  , a little adjustment in my neck. And as long as it's not painful, that's fine. So again, this one's just a little bit more continuous movement to get that mobilization in there. So I'm gonna do the other way so you can see it. So now I'm kind of stabilizing with this side. I'm tucking in my chin and then I'm using that towel just to help get that little bit of a turn. Little pause, come back in and relax and reset myself. So again you have to work a little bit at this to get the movement. Sometimes it's hard to do all those combinations but if you can get it right you're really going to get that stiffness out of there. So it works really really well. So the next one is going to just be a levator scapulae stretch and that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck.

Then you want to take your other hand and place it kind of behind your head, and you're going to pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there. And it should be a good kind of hurt so good feeling, but it shouldn't be painful at all. So again, holding that for 30 seconds, doing that three times, probably on each side if you've got just some general neck stiffness, and you can do that a couple times a day. So I'll do the other side, holding this one up with my elbow, hand behind my head, pulling down towards the opposite side. So again, really holding it for 30 seconds, get that good stretch in there. I like to alternate back and forth. You don't have to. You can do them all on one side, all on the other side, but I feel like when you alternate back and fo\n",
